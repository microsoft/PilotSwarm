## Workflow

1. Identify whether the app should use the shipped TUI rather than a custom UI.
2. Run a guided intake before scaffolding.
3. Create `plugin/plugin.json` when the user wants app branding.
4. Put reusable methods in `plugin/skills`, executable actions in worker tools or MCP servers, and use `plugin/agents/*.agent.md` only for complex authored workflows or durable named entry points. Packages without agents remain valid and are progressively discoverable by Base Agent V2 sessions.
5. Every generated `.agent.md` must include `schemaVersion: 1` and a `version` string. Use `version: 1.0.0` for new agents by default. When editing an existing agent, bump its `version` according to the app's versioning style; prefer SemVer when the app uses it.
6. Treat `plugin/agents/default.agent.md` as the app-wide default overlay under PilotSwarm's embedded framework base. It is **not** a selectable session agent — PilotSwarm excludes it from the agent picker, the client rejects `createSession` calls with `agentId: "default"`, and the worker never adds it to `allowedAgentNames`. Do not name any other agent file `default`.
6. Put reusable domain knowledge in `plugin/skills/*/SKILL.md`.
7. Put runtime tool handlers in `worker-module.js`.
8. Add `session-policy.json` if the user does not want generic sessions. The policy is enforced in both local and remote modes — the TUI reads it from the plugin directory even when there are no embedded workers. If the app should expose SDK-bundled optional agents, add them under `creation.bundledAgents`, for example `"bundledAgents": ["generic-crawler"]`; remote-mode picker metadata expands those names into creatable agents.
9. Build `.env.example` and a gitignored `.env` by copying/adapting the PilotSwarm repo's example env shape when the user wants runnable scaffolding.
10. Build `.model_providers.example.json` and a gitignored `.model_providers.json` by copying/adapting the PilotSwarm repo's example model-catalog shape when the scaffold needs a custom model catalog.
11. Add checked-in scripts for launch and database cleanup (both local and remote modes).
12. Make generated scripts executable and verify the executable bit.
13. Add a README with local run instructions.
14. When agents need durable structured memory or shared coordination state, use PilotSwarm's built-in facts tools (`store_fact`, `read_facts`, `delete_fact`) as the primary memory layer. They are available to every agent session by default, including system agents, so do not build a separate fact table unless the app truly requires it.
15. When agents need recurring autonomous work, use durable timers: `cron(seconds=N, reason="...")` for fixed intervals, `cron_at(minute=M, hour=H, tz="Area/City", reason="...")` for wall-clock schedules, and `cron(action="cancel")` / `cron_at(action="cancel")` to stop. Do not build wall-clock jobs by waking every N minutes to check the clock.
16. When generated agents delegate work, teach them to set `contract.wakeOn`: `any` for chatty work, `material_change` for finite task results and watcher changes, and `completion` only for actual terminal lifecycle outcomes. A finite child's ordinary final reply leaves it alive and idle, so generated parents validate the result and close it explicitly with `complete_agent`. Parent coordination is reactive: qualifying updates wake the parent automatically, so never generate a parent `wait`/`cron` loop whose only action is `check_agents`.
16. Agents can read their context usage (current tokens, token limit) from the session status. The TUI displays this in the status bar. Use this for agents that need to manage context window budgets or trigger compaction.
17. If the app relies on downloadable files, document the shipped files inspector behavior: binary artifacts download intact, browser previews are download-only for non-text files, and the shared files browser supports download/delete/open flows.

## Guided Intake Questions

Before generating files, ask:

1. Should the app allow generic sessions under the default agent, or should usage be steered into named agents through a restrictive session policy?
2. Should local startup use a bootstrap `GITHUB_TOKEN`, or will the first
  runtime provider be created through Admin Console/management API?
3. What should be used for `DATABASE_URL` in `.env`?
4. What local database name should the scaffold use? If unspecified, default it explicitly to the workspace name.
5. If the user has not specified the agent roster, what workflows should the app support so you can derive the first agent set?
6. Which topology should the scaffold target?
   - local-only, using Docker Postgres
   - standard remote topology using AKS + PostgreSQL + Blob storage
   - custom topology supplied by the user

Do not guess these answers when the user has not provided them. Offer the standard topology choices explicitly so the guided experience stays fast.

## Env File Guidance

- Treat `DATABASE_URL` as the canonical PostgreSQL connection input for LOCAL
  mode (embedded workers). Remote attach needs only the portal URL:
  `npx pilotswarm remote --api-url <url>` (auto Entra sign-in;
  `--device-code` for headless hosts).
- If the app needs a custom model catalog, check in a type-only
  `.model_providers.example.json` and create the real `.model_providers.json`
  locally from it. Add provider instances/credentials through Admin or
  `PilotSwarmManagementClient`, and configure `setModelDefault` /
  `setSystemModelDefault`; do not put credentials or `defaultModel` in new
  catalogs.
- For local-first scaffolds, offer GitHub Copilot as the first runtime provider
  type unless the user asks for another; do not hard-code a provider instance
  or credential into the catalog.
- For local-first scaffolds, do not include `LLM_PROVIDER_TYPE`, `LLM_ENDPOINT`, `LLM_API_KEY`, or `LLM_API_VERSION` by default.
- Do not generate redundant `PGHOST`, `PGPORT`, `PGUSER`, `PGPASSWORD`, or `PGDATABASE` entries unless the user explicitly needs them.
- Prefer a checked-in `.env.example` plus a local gitignored `.env`.
- Prefer a checked-in `.model_providers.example.json` plus a local gitignored `.model_providers.json`.
- Add both `.env` and `.model_providers.json` to `.gitignore` in runnable scaffolds.
- Align the variable set with the chosen topology rather than blindly copying every sample env field.
- For local-first scaffolds, the default env surface should usually be
  `DATABASE_URL`; add `GITHUB_TOKEN` only when using bootstrap compatibility.
- Add optional storage or deployment variables only when the topology requires them.
- Only copy secrets from another repo or local file after the user explicitly asks for that behavior.

## Database Cleanup Guidance

- Generate a single cleanup script (`scripts/cleanup-local-db.js`) that handles both local and remote modes:
  - `node scripts/cleanup-local-db.js` — uses `.env` (local)
  - `node scripts/cleanup-local-db.js remote` — uses `.env.remote`
- Parse `sslmode` from the `DATABASE_URL` and pass `ssl: { rejectUnauthorized: false }` to the `pg` client when connecting to Azure PostgreSQL. Follow the pattern in the DevOps sample's cleanup script.
- Query session IDs from CMS (`copilot_sessions.sessions`) before dropping schemas.
- In local mode, also remove local files for each session:
  - Artifact directories at `~/.copilot/artifacts/<sessionId>/`
  - Session state dirs at `~/.copilot/session-state/<sessionId>/`
  - Session store archives at `~/.copilot/session-store/<sessionId>.tar.gz` and `.meta.json`
- In remote mode, skip local file cleanup (artifacts live in blob storage).
- Drop `duroxide` and `copilot_sessions` schemas.
- In remote mode, print the `kubectl rollout restart` command to recreate schemas.
- Wire `package.json` scripts:
  - `"cleanup": "node scripts/cleanup-local-db.js"`
  - `"cleanup:remote": "node scripts/cleanup-local-db.js remote"`
- Follow the pattern in PilotSwarm's DevOps sample `scripts/cleanup-local-db.js`.

## Launcher Script Guidance

- Generate a single `scripts/run.sh` that supports both local and remote modes:
  - `./scripts/run.sh` or `./scripts/run.sh local` — local mode with embedded workers
  - `./scripts/run.sh remote` — remote mode connecting to AKS workers
- Wire `package.json` scripts to point at `run.sh`:
  - `"start": "./scripts/run.sh"` for local
  - `"start:remote": "./scripts/run.sh remote"` for remote
- Use `.env` for local mode and `.env.remote` for remote mode. The script selects the right file based on the mode argument.
- Include preflight checks (env file exists, plugin dir exists, worker module exists for local).
- Use `exec npx pilotswarm ...` for local and `exec npx pilotswarm remote ...` for remote.
- Make the script executable and verify the executable bit after creation.
- Keep compatibility workarounds in the launcher or `postinstall` scripts, not scattered across README steps.

## Validation Guidance

- When the user wants runnable scaffolding, do more than write files: install dependencies and run a smoke test.
- Do not treat `--help` output as proof that the app actually starts; prefer the real startup path when practical.
- Check the declared runtime requirements and compare them against the current machine.
- If scripts are intended to be run directly, verify direct execution rather than only `node script.js`.
- If the scaffold defaults or inferred decisions matter, record them in the generated README.

## Compatibility Guidance

- If the generated app hits a known dependency issue during setup, isolate the workaround in setup or launcher scripts and explain why it exists.
- Prefer deterministic fixes that can be re-applied after reinstall, such as `postinstall` or a verified pre-launch patch step, over one-off manual instructions.
- Remove or simplify compatibility shims once the upstream dependency is fixed.

## Agent Derivation Guidance

- If the user names agents, scaffold those agents directly.
- If the user only describes workflows, derive a starter agent set from those workflows and explain the mapping.
- Keep the first scaffold minimal but coherent; do not invent a large agent roster without justification.

## `plugin.json` Guidance

Use `plugin.json` for metadata and TUI branding.

Example:

```json
{
  "name": "devops",
  "description": "DevOps Command Center",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "tui": {
    "title": "DevOps Command Center",
    "splashFile": "./tui-splash.txt"
  }
}
```

## Guardrails

- Do not put tool implementations into agent markdown files.
- Do not model developer-facing builder behavior as runtime system agents.
- Keep prompts, skills, tool handlers, and branding in separate layers.
- If you add or change TUI keybindings, update help/keybinding surfaces together.
- Treat system-agent `initialPrompt` as bootstrap startup content, not a user-authored chat line.
- Assume apps consume `pilotswarm` and `pilotswarm-sdk`; built-in PilotSwarm plugins are embedded in those packages, not copied into the app repo.
- Assume PostgreSQL-backed apps can opt into the built-in facts tools with agent `tools` lists instead of re-implementing fact storage from scratch.
- Prefer generated app instructions that install `pilotswarm` and `pilotswarm-sdk` from npm before suggesting local clone or link workflows.
- If the scaffold teaches artifact workflows, do not describe them as markdown-only; explain the shared binary-download contract too.
