# PilotSwarm Builder Templates

These are distributable skills and optional Copilot custom-agent entry points for users who are building apps on top of PilotSwarm.

They are not active in this repository. Copy the relevant templates into the target repository you want to assist. Reusable methods belong in skills; create an agent file when a complex scenario needs prepackaged workflow choreography or an independent durable entry point.

## Optional Agent Entry Points

- `pilotswarm-cli-builder` — scaffolds plugin-driven CLI/TUI apps built on the shipped PilotSwarm UI
- `pilotswarm-portal-builder` — scaffolds browser-portal customization, portal branding, and auth add-on wiring
- `pilotswarm-sdk-builder` — scaffolds SDK-first apps and services built around `PilotSwarmClient` and `PilotSwarmWorker`
- `pilotswarm-azure-deployer` — prepares PilotSwarm-based apps for Azure / AKS deployment, including env templates, manifests, and worker observability

## Included Skills (split for focused retrieval)

- `pilotswarm-cli-builder` — CLI/TUI scaffold guidance, env files, launcher scripts
- `pilotswarm-portal-builder` — portal branding, `plugin.json.portal`, auth add-ons, and deployment wiring
- `pilotswarm-sdk-builder` — SDK app scaffold guidance, client/worker split, tests
- `pilotswarm-agent-versioning` — `.agent.md` schema/version frontmatter and version bump guidance
- `pilotswarm-hybrid-datastore` — stock PostgreSQL runtime storage plus optional HorizonDB enhanced facts/search/graph wiring
- `pilotswarm-knowledge-harvester` — optional EnhancedFactStore + knowledge-graph wiring, `crawler: true` agent template, crawl→graph→reader flow, ACL/evidence model, tests
- `pilotswarm-duroxide-versioning` — durable orchestration versioning, continue-as-new upgrades, compatibility rules
- `pilotswarm-azure-deployer` — deployment workflow, manifests, env checklist, `RUST_LOG` observability
- `pilotswarm-aks-identity` — cross-cluster AKS access, Workload Identity, kubectl patterns
- `pilotswarm-azure-lessons` — RBAC conditional access workaround, PostgreSQL region restrictions, Key Vault + CSI
- `pilotswarm-three-tier` — dedicated worker-cluster topology for long-running or dehydration-resistant jobs

These templates assume apps consume:

- `pilotswarm-sdk`
- `pilotswarm` (the app package: TUI + portal + MCP bins)

from npm:

```bash
npm install pilotswarm-sdk
npm install pilotswarm
```

and that PilotSwarm's built-in framework and management plugins are embedded in those packages while app `default.agent.md` files act as app-wide overlays.

Published packages may contain skills, worker tools, and MCP servers without any
agent files. Base Agent V2 sessions can discover those visible capabilities on
demand. Keep named agents for workflows whose ordering, checks, outputs, or
durable responsibility should be packaged rather than reconstructed from a
generic prompt.

If the target app needs a custom model catalog, check in
`.model_providers.example.json` as a credential-free provider-type template and
create a local gitignored `.model_providers.json` from it. Shared/personal
provider instances, credentials, defaults, and budgets are runtime CMS state;
runnable scaffolds should teach Admin Console or management API setup rather
than copying provider keys into the catalog.

PilotSwarm includes built-in facts tools (`store_fact`, `read_facts`, `delete_fact`) on workers, and they are available to every agent session by default, including system agents. Use them for durable structured memory and shared cross-agent state instead of inventing an app-specific facts table unless the app truly needs one.

PilotSwarm also ships optional SDK-bundled named agents under its `default-agents` tier. They stay hidden unless an app opts in through `session-policy.json` with `creation.bundledAgents`, for example `"bundledAgents": ["generic-crawler"]`. Builder templates should teach that opt-in instead of copying bundled agent files, unless the app needs to customize the agent.

Every generated app `.agent.md` should include `schemaVersion: 1` and a `version` string. Use `version: 1.0.0` for new agents by default, prefer SemVer for app convenience, and bump the version string when changing an existing agent's prompt behavior, tool expectations, workflow guidance, metadata, output shape, or child-contract expectations. Use `schemaVersion: 3` only when declaring `initialRequiredTool` for enforced first-turn execution; the named tool must also appear in `tools`. Use `schemaVersion: 4` when declaring per-profile `nativeTaskTools` allowlists for synchronous native Copilot tasks; parent tool permissions still apply, and durable/session-control tools remain unavailable. See [native task tools](../../docs/developer/native-task-tools.md).

Generated agents should use `cron(seconds=N, reason="...")` for fixed-interval recurring work and `cron_at(minute=M, hour=H, tz="Area/City", reason="...")` for wall-clock schedules. Do not teach agents to wake every N minutes just to check whether a calendar time has arrived. For long-running child sessions, include `contract.wakeOn` guidance so watcher children default to `material_change` instead of waking parents for no-op heartbeats. Qualifying child updates wake the parent automatically; do not generate a parent timer whose only action is `check_agents`.

Artifact workflows should assume the consolidated `write_artifact` / `read_artifact` / `list_artifacts` surface. Files that already exist on the worker (builds, archives, binaries) upload via `write_artifact({fromFile})` and download via `read_artifact({toFile})` — bytes stream server-side and every result carries a `sha256` plus the `artifact://` link. Reserve inline `content` (with `contentType` + base64 for small binaries) for text the agent is authoring, and explain that the browser portal downloads binary artifacts rather than previewing them inline.

The CLI builder template also assumes runnable scaffolds should:

- generate checked-in launcher and cleanup scripts
- make those scripts executable
- verify direct script execution rather than only relying on `node script.js`

One way to install from a clone of the PilotSwarm repo:

```bash
mkdir -p .github/agents .github/skills
cp templates/builder-agents/agents/*.agent.md .github/agents/
cp -R templates/builder-agents/skills/* .github/skills/
```

## Topology Baseline (all templates assume this)

Every deployment exposes one integration surface: the portal's Web API
(`/api/v1` + `/api/v1/ws`). Clients — TUI (`npx pilotswarm remote --api-url`),
SDK apps (`new PilotSwarmClient({ apiUrl })`), the MCP server
(`pilotswarm-mcp --api-url`), and custom UXes on `pilotswarm-sdk/api` —
hold only the portal URL (plus an Entra token where auth is enabled). Only
workers and the portal server itself hold `DATABASE_URL`/blob/`HORIZON_*`
secrets. Direct `{ store }` client construction is for single-process demos,
tests, and cleanup scripts. See
`https://github.com/affandar/pilotswarm/blob/main/docs/architecture/layering.md`.

## Canonical References

For multi-user deployments, choose the admin policy explicitly.
`AUTHZ_ADMIN_SCOPE=cluster` requires authentication and
`AUTHZ_ENFORCE_OWNERSHIP=true` on workers and the portal. Admins retain cluster
controls and all-user token accounting, but use ordinary session/package
ownership and shares. Admin access to privileged system sessions remains;
this mode is not complete isolation from administrators.
See the AKS guide below for rollout order and the accepted system-session exception.

## Maintenance Rule

If PilotSwarm adds features or changes behavior relevant to app builders, update these templates as part of the same change whenever practical.
