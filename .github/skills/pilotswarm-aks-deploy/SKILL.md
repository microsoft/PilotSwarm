# PilotSwarm AKS Deploy

Use this skill when the user wants to deploy PilotSwarm to AKS, refresh AKS env/secret state, or verify the live cluster after a rollout.

Keep the workflow repo-specific and explicit. Prefer the repo-owned scripts, and treat secret/env changes as part of the deploy surface, not as an afterthought.

This skill deploys `pilotswarm` only. Do not roll the same change into downstream projects or other clusters (for example `waldemort` or an app repo with a vendored PilotSwarm copy) unless the user explicitly asks for that separate deployment.

## Canonical Targets

- Kubernetes context: resolve `K8S_CONTEXT` from `.env.remote`
- Namespace: resolve `K8S_NAMESPACE` from `.env.remote`
- Worker deployment: `copilot-runtime-worker`
- Portal deployment: `pilotswarm-portal`
- Worker image: `${ACR_NAME}.azurecr.io/copilot-runtime-worker:latest`
- Portal image: `${ACR_NAME}.azurecr.io/pilotswarm-portal:latest`
- ACR: resolve `ACR_NAME` from `.env.remote`
- Azure subscription/resource ownership: prove from the active account, ingress IP, and ACR resource rather than assuming a resource group
- Portal DNS: resolve from live `pilotswarm-portal-ingress` and verify against public DNS
- Postgres server: resolve the host from `.env.remote` `DATABASE_URL`
- Location: derive from the proven AKS/public-IP resources

Do not hard-code `ACR_NAME` on the deploy command line — `scripts/deploy-aks.sh` sources `.env.remote` after parsing the environment, so the `.env.remote` value wins. Set `ACR_NAME` in `.env.remote` if you need to override the default.

Set `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` in `.env.remote`. The `az` CLI keeps its active subscription in `~/.azure` — **global** state shared by every terminal and editor window — so deploying another environment (chk lives in a different subscription) from a second VS Code window silently repoints this one. The deploy scripts pass `--subscription "$AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID"` to every `az acr` call when the variable is set, which turns that drift into a no-op instead of a confusing `The resource with name '<acr>' … could not be found in subscription '…'`. Unset, the scripts fall back to ambient `az` state and the drift returns.

Subscription IDs are not recorded in this repo. Resolve the value the same way this skill resolves every other piece of topology — from the live resources — and put it in `.env.remote`, which is gitignored:

```bash
az account list --output table          # pick the one owning the ACR below
az acr show --name "$ACR_NAME" --query id -o tsv   # /subscriptions/<id>/resourceGroups/...
```

## Canonical Files

- Worker deploy script: `scripts/deploy-aks.sh` — **worker only**; it does
  not build or roll the portal.
- Portal deploy script: `scripts/deploy-portal.sh` — builds/pushes the
  portal image and rolls `pilotswarm-portal`.
- **"Update the cluster" means running BOTH scripts.** The 2026-07-04
  v0.4.1 rollout ran only `deploy-aks.sh` and left the portal serving the
  previous bundle until `deploy-portal.sh` was run separately. Do not
  report a cluster deploy complete until the portal-served asset hash has
  changed:
  ```bash
  PORTAL_HOST=$(kubectl get ingress pilotswarm-portal-ingress -n "$K8S_NAMESPACE" \
    -o jsonpath='{.spec.rules[0].host}')
  curl -sk "https://$PORTAL_HOST/" | grep -oE "assets/index-[A-Za-z0-9_-]+\.js"
  ```
- Remote reset script: `scripts/reset-db-aks.sh` (wraps `scripts/db-reset.js`) — **never part of a deploy**; see the `pilotswarm-aks-reset` skill and the NO RESETS rule below.
- Worker manifest: `deploy/k8s/worker-deployment.yaml`
- Portal manifest: `deploy/k8s/portal-deployment.yaml`
- Portal ingress: `deploy/k8s/portal-ingress.yaml`
- Worker Dockerfile: `deploy/Dockerfile.worker`
- Portal Dockerfile: `deploy/Dockerfile.portal`
- Namespace manifest: `deploy/k8s/namespace.yaml`
- AKS guide: `docs/developer/deploy/aks.md`
- Model catalog template: `.model_providers.example.json`
- Real runtime catalog: `.model_providers.json`

## Core Learnings

- Use `docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64` for AKS images. Do not use a plain `docker build` from Apple Silicon for cluster deploys.
- **Images build through an npm mirror, not public npm.** Microsoft-managed devices are hard-blocked from `registry.npmjs.org`, and **containers inherit the block** — a Docker build gets no special egress. Proven 2026-07-31: host `curl` → `http=000` (socket not connected), in-container `fetch` → `ECONNRESET`, in-container `fetch` of `https://packagefeedproxy.microsoft.io/npm/` → `200`. Both Dockerfiles take an `NPM_REGISTRY` build arg (`ARG NPM_REGISTRY` + `ENV npm_config_registry`) that `deploy-aks.sh` and `deploy-portal.sh` pass through from `.env.remote`, where `NPM_REGISTRY=https://packagefeedproxy.microsoft.io/npm/` is set. It defaults to public npm when unset, so unmanaged machines are unaffected. npm's `replace-registry-host` (default `npmjs`) rewrites the lockfile's `resolved` URLs onto the mirror, so `package-lock.json` stays authoritative and integrity hashes still gate every tarball.
  - **Any hand-rolled `docker buildx build` must pass `--build-arg NPM_REGISTRY="$NPM_REGISTRY"`** or it will fail at `npm ci` on a managed device. The repo scripts do this for you, and the manual recipes in this skill, `pilotswarm-corp-aks-deploy`, and `pilotswarm-aks-reset` carry it. The commands in `docs/developer/deploy/aks.md` do NOT — add the arg if you copy from there.
  - **`az acr build` is the exact opposite: do NOT pass `NPM_REGISTRY`.** The build runs on an Azure build agent with unrestricted access to public npm, so the corp mirror buys nothing there — and its 7-day quarantine actively breaks the build. Sourcing `.env.remote` into the shell that launches `az acr build` is enough to poison it, because the mirror is set there for the *local* path. Observed 2026-08-02: `npm error 404 … GET https://packagefeedproxy.microsoft.io/npm/vite/-/vite-7.3.6.tgz — Cannot find the file … in feed 'npm-public'`, on a version that was fine on public npm. Rule of thumb: **mirror for local builds, public npm for ACR builds.**
  - A cached `npm ci` layer hides all of this — a build can succeed having never touched the network. Do not read a green build as proof the mirror path works; that only holds on a cold cache (`--no-cache`, a lockfile change, a pruned builder, or a fresh clone).
  - Reaching the mirror is not the same as finding your package on it. The feed imposes a deliberate **7-day quarantine** on newly published versions, so a same-week `pilotswarm-sdk` release will 404 there regardless of this wiring.
  - When the deployment must consume the just-published PilotSwarm packages,
    do not wait out the quarantine and do not quietly fall back to workspace
    source. Use the three `.tgz` assets attached to the GitHub Release and the
    release-tarball workflow below. ACR still supplies public-npm access for
    third-party transitive dependencies; PilotSwarm package bytes come from
    the downloaded release assets.
  - `deploy/Dockerfile.starter` still lacks the arg.
- The deploy target is the AKS cluster, not the local namespace. Use `copilot-runtime`, not the local `pilotswarm` namespace.
- The deploy script prefers `.env.remote`, then `.env`, and pushes env-backed provider keys into the Kubernetes secret.
- `.model_providers.example.json` is the checked-in shareable model-catalog template. The real `.model_providers.json` is local and gitignored so personal service URLs can stay out of source control.
- The legacy Dockerfiles copy `.model_providers.json*` from the build context, so a stale private catalog can override correct released metadata. Never overwrite the private file to prepare a release image. Build from an explicit checked-in deploy catalog and verify `/app/.model_providers.json` plus `listModels()` after rollout.
- Provider visibility is still controlled by env-backed keys at worker startup, not by which providers appear in the template.
- Secret updates matter for model selectors. Workers load provider availability at startup, so removed keys do not take effect until the secret is refreshed and the pods restart.
- The AKS rollout needs a valid `acr-pull` registry secret wired into the worker deployment. Refresh that pull secret as part of deployment, not only the env secret.
- During destructive resets, do not drop the `duroxide` schema immediately after scaling the deployment to `0`. Wait until the worker pods are actually gone, or old prepared statements can trip Postgres errors like `cached plan must not change result type`.
- When the active default model is an Azure OpenAI deployment, the Kubernetes secret must include the matching Azure OpenAI key. A missing `AZURE_OAI_KEY` can leave workers booting with an invalid default model.
- If `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is intentionally removed from the deploy env, refresh the Kubernetes secret and restart workers, then verify Anthropic models disappeared from selectors or `list_available_models`.
- Old worker pods in another namespace can still poll the same database and cause nondeterminism. Check all namespaces if behavior looks impossible.
- After a destructive reset, healthy workers will immediately recreate the built-in system sessions. Verify the fresh root `PilotSwarm Agent` instead of expecting the catalog to stay empty.
- The AKS rollout needs a valid `acr-pull` registry secret wired into the worker and portal deployments. ACR tokens expire — if pods show `ErrImagePull` / `401 Unauthorized`, refresh the `acr-pull` secret:
  ```bash
  ACR_TOKEN=$(az acr login --name "$ACR_NAME" --expose-token --query accessToken -o tsv) && \
  kubectl create secret docker-registry acr-pull -n copilot-runtime \
    --docker-server="$ACR_NAME.azurecr.io" \
    --docker-username=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000 \
    --docker-password="$ACR_TOKEN" --dry-run=client -o yaml | kubectl apply -f -
  ```
- When starting all workers simultaneously against a fresh DB, duroxide migrations can race. Duroxide 0.1.19+ uses advisory locks to handle this safely — workers that lose the race will retry and succeed. Earlier versions crash on duplicate migration keys.
- Portal listens on port 3001 (HTTP) internally; TLS termination happens at the app-routing nginx ingress.
- Portal is publicly accessible with Entra ID as the sole access gate.
- VPN Gateway P2S is a feature of the **GitOps IaC path** (`deploy/scripts/deploy.mjs` + base-infra bicep), not this legacy `scripts/deploy-aks.sh` flow. If a user mentions VPN-enabled stamps, route them to the `pilotswarm-new-env-deploy` skill ("Optional: VPN Gateway P2S" section) and `docs/developer/deploy/aks.md`. Two operator-visible costs to surface up-front when discussing VPN: **45+ minutes** added to the first deploy (gateway provisioning is the long pole) and **~$450/month** runtime cost for `VpnGw2AZ` + Azure Private DNS Resolver (~$280 gateway + ~$170 resolver inbound endpoint). The Resolver is co-provisioned with the VPN gateway because P2S clients cannot reach 168.63.129.16 through the tunnel — without it, clients cannot resolve the portal Private DNS Zone hostname. Generation1 SKUs including `VpnGw1AZ` are excluded — they silently drop OpenVPN+AAD HardResetClientV2 packets. Subsequent param-change deploys are minutes, not 45+.

## Default Deploy Workflow

If the user requires runtime configuration and model defaults to remain
unchanged, do not run legacy scripts that recreate `copilot-runtime-secrets`
or reapply deployment settings from local files. Run the same full
`./scripts/run-tests.sh --all-providers` gate, build with the canonical
Dockerfiles, and update only container image references to verified immutable
digests. Record and compare the existing pod specs, secret data hashes, model
defaults, and catalog hashes before/after. Roll the portal before MCP. This is
an image-only variant of the deploy, with no data reset or config refresh.

1. Inspect the deploy surface.
   - Run `git status --short`.
   - Review `.model_providers.example.json`, the real `.model_providers.json` when the user has asked for local config changes, `scripts/deploy-aks.sh`, and `deploy/k8s/worker-deployment.yaml` if model/env/deploy behavior changed.

2. Verify the target env and cluster assumptions.
   - Prefer `.env.remote` for AKS deploys.
   - Confirm the current context/namespace before changing remote state.
  - Confirm the active Azure subscription before public-IP ownership, ACR, or deploy operations. A blank ownership result often indicates the wrong subscription, not an unowned IP.
   - If the change removes a provider key, plan to verify the live model surface after rollout.

3. Use the canonical deploy script unless there is a concrete reason not to.
   Deploys are always non-destructive: sessions, orchestrations, and facts
   survive every deploy. There is no reset step or reset flag in a deploy.
   - Full deploy:
     ```bash
     ./scripts/deploy-aks.sh
     ```
   - Reuse existing image:
     ```bash
     ./scripts/deploy-aks.sh --skip-build
     ```
   - Skip the local test gate only when the user explicitly accepts the risk:
     ```bash
     ./scripts/deploy-aks.sh --skip-tests
     ```

4. If a manual deploy is needed, follow the same order as the script.
   - Refresh the Kubernetes secret from the current env.
   - Refresh the `acr-pull` image-pull secret from ACR credentials/token.
   - Run the local test gate unless explicitly skipped.
   - Never fold a database reset into a manual deploy sequence — a reset is a separate operation (see the NO RESETS rule).
   - Build the SDK:
     ```bash
     npm run build -w packages/sdk
     ```
   - Login to ACR:
     ```bash
     az acr login --name "$ACR_NAME"
     ```
   - Build and push the image:
     ```bash
     docker buildx build \
         --platform linux/amd64 \
         -f deploy/Dockerfile.worker \
         --build-arg NPM_REGISTRY="${NPM_REGISTRY:-https://registry.npmjs.org/}" \
         -t "$ACR_NAME.azurecr.io/copilot-runtime-worker:latest" \
         --push .
     ```
   - Apply namespace/deployment manifests and restart the deployment.

5. Verify the rollout.
   - Check rollout status:
     ```bash
     kubectl rollout status deployment/copilot-runtime-worker -n copilot-runtime --timeout=120s
     ```
   - Check pod readiness:
     ```bash
     kubectl get pods -n copilot-runtime -l app.kubernetes.io/component=worker
     ```
   - Check recent logs:
     ```bash
     kubectl logs -n copilot-runtime -l app.kubernetes.io/component=worker --prefix --tail=50
     ```
   - If image correctness matters, inspect the running image IDs from the pods.
  - Wait for old ReplicaSet pods to disappear before choosing a pod for file/catalog checks; rollout completion can overlap with terminating pods.
   - If the rollout stalls in `ErrImagePull` or `ImagePullBackOff`, inspect the pod events first; a stale `acr-pull` secret is a likely cause.

6. Verify model-surface changes when env keys changed.
   - If a provider key was added or removed, do not stop at "pods are Running".
   - Verify the live selector surface in the TUI or through `list_available_models`.
  - Inspect the embedded runtime catalog too; compiled metadata support does not prove the image contains the intended catalog values.
   - For Anthropic removal specifically, confirm Anthropic entries no longer appear after the restart.

7. If the deploy followed a destructive reset, verify the rebuilt system baseline.
   - Confirm the recreated `PilotSwarm Agent` is present and not failed.
   - Confirm the expected system children (`Sweeper Agent`, `Resource Manager Agent`, `Facts Manager`) were respawned.

## GitHub Release Tarball Deploy

Use this path when the user says the AKS images must pull PilotSwarm packages
from GitHub Release tarballs, or when a same-week release is quarantined by the
corporate npm mirror. It is a package-source change, not a database reset.

1. Wait for release assets.
   - Require the npm workflow and its `Attach package tarballs to the Release`
     job to succeed.
   - Verify the Release contains the expected app, SDK, and Horizon Store
     tarballs, then download them into a temporary ignored directory with
     `gh release download <tag> --pattern '*.tgz' --dir <temp-dir>`.
   - Record SHA-256 for every asset and extract each `package/package.json` to
     verify package name and version. Do not trust filenames alone.

2. Build a minimal temporary image context.
   - A private root `package.json` should depend on all three local assets with
     `file:release/<asset>.tgz`; `npm install --omit=dev --force` then installs
     the PilotSwarm package trees from those bytes while resolving only
     third-party dependencies through public npm.
   - Copy `scripts/postinstall.js` from the exact release tag and run it after
     installation so the Copilot SDK ESM compatibility patch is preserved.
   - Preserve existing manifest/runtime paths with symlinks:
     `/app/packages/sdk -> ../node_modules/pilotswarm-sdk`,
     `/app/packages/horizon-store -> ../node_modules/pilotswarm-horizon-store`,
     and `/app/packages/app -> ../node_modules/pilotswarm`.
   - The worker package does not ship `examples/worker.js`; copy that bootstrap
     from the exact release tag into the worker image, but keep all SDK/app
     implementation bytes sourced from the tarballs.
   - Inject `deploy/config/model_providers.ghcp.json` from the exact release tag
     as `/app/.model_providers.json`. Never copy the private gitignored catalog.
   - Label both images with `org.opencontainers.image.version`,
     `org.opencontainers.image.revision`, `io.pilotswarm.package-source`, and
     the three asset hashes (`io.pilotswarm.sdk.sha256`,
     `io.pilotswarm.horizon-store.sha256`, `io.pilotswarm.app.sha256`). These
     labels are the cheap pre-rollout proof of package provenance.

3. Build in ACR from inside the temporary context.
   - Use `az acr build` without `NPM_REGISTRY`; ACR can reach public npm and the
     corporate mirror would reintroduce quarantine failures.
   - `az acr build --file` resolves relative to its current source context.
     `pushd` into the temporary context and use `--file Dockerfile.worker .` or
     `--file Dockerfile.portal .`; passing a bare filename while standing at
     the repo root fails before submission.
   - Build `copilot-runtime-worker:latest` and
     `pilotswarm-portal:latest`. The latter also backs the MCP deployment.

4. Prove provenance before rollout.
   - Inspect `:latest` digests in ACR and use
     `docker buildx imagetools inspect --format '{{json .Image.Config.Labels}}'`
     to confirm the tag, commit, Release URL, and asset hashes.
   - Do not roll an earlier source-context fallback image merely because its
     ACR build succeeded; only the labeled tarball image is the candidate.

5. Roll without rebuilding.
   - Refresh workers with `./scripts/deploy-aks.sh --skip-build` (add
     `--skip-tests` only with explicit user approval), then run
     `./scripts/deploy-portal.sh --skip-build`.
   - If the cluster has `pilotswarm-mcp`, wait for portal readiness and run
     `./scripts/deploy-mcp.sh --skip-build` so it adopts the same digest.

6. Verify package identity, not just readiness.
   - Check every running `imageID` equals the expected ACR digest and that pods
     have zero restarts.
   - In a worker and portal pod, read the three
     `/app/node_modules/<package>/package.json` versions and require the release
     version. Verify `/app/.model_providers.json` hashes to the checked-in
     deployment catalog.
   - Extract `package/web/dist/index.html` from the downloaded app tarball and
     require its `assets/index-*.js` value to match both the portal pod and the
     public portal. This proves the browser is serving the attached asset, not
     merely another image with the same semantic version.
   - Verify health, DNS/ingress, TLS, serious-log scans, and workers across all
     namespaces. MCP initialize requires
     `Accept: application/json, text/event-stream`; omitting it produces a
     correct `-32000 Not Acceptable` response, not a server failure.
   - Remove the temporary build context and downloaded assets, then confirm the
     tracked worktree is unchanged.

## Secret Hygiene Rules

- Treat secret refresh as part of deployment, not a separate optional step.
- The deploy script already pushes:
  - `DATABASE_URL`
  - `GITHUB_TOKEN` when present
  - `AZURE_STORAGE_*` when present
  - `AZURE_FW_GLM5_KEY`
  - `AZURE_KIMI_K25_KEY`
  - `AZURE_OAI_KEY`
  - `AZURE_GPT51_KEY`
  - `AZURE_MODEL_ROUTER_KEY`
  - `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
- If a provider should disappear from selectors, make sure the corresponding env var is absent in the deploy env and then verify the restarted cluster reflects it.

## Verification Fallbacks

- If `kubectl` or `kubelogin` is flaky locally, use `az aks command invoke` for cluster-side verification instead of assuming rollout state.
- If local admin credentials are disabled, prefer the same cluster-side verification path rather than trying to force `--admin`.

## Extra Checks For Weird Behavior

- If live embedding checks time out, inspect unfinished test embedder loops before changing test deadlines. `cleanup-test-schemas.js` preserves run IDs whose temporary directories are less than six hours old, and its HorizonDB cleanup covers `ps_test_facts_*`, not the provider tests' generated `hzt_*`/`hzg_*` schemas. Completed test runs can therefore leave loops consuming scheduler capacity.
  - For test-data cleanup, first inventory the exact generated schemas and their `hz-embed-*-cron:<schema>` instance IDs. Check for active test runners and preserve resources belonging to active runs.
  - Cancel only those test instances through `df.cancel`, remove their AGE graphs through `drop_graph`, then drop the inventoried test schemas and unset only their schema-specific `hz_<schema>_<suffix>` variables. Do not clear shared durable variables or reset runtime data.
  - A broad `hzg_*` match is unsafe: named evaluation graphs such as `hzg_eval` and `hzg_sw_*` are not generated integration-test fixtures. Preserve those and all non-test workflows.
  - Rerun `./scripts/run-tests.sh --with-horizondb embedder` with the original assertions, deadlines, and parallelism. On 2026-09-07, removing 14 orphan test loops cleared the three embedding timeouts; all 17 lifecycle/outcome checks then passed in 204 seconds without code or configuration changes.
- Check for old worker pods across all namespaces:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -l app.kubernetes.io/component=worker --no-headers
  ```
- If the cluster looks healthy but behavior is stale, confirm the running pods are actually on the expected image and secret revision.
- If the portal image also backs a separate MCP deployment, roll MCP only after the portal is Ready and smoke its public initialize route. Inspect previous logs for transient portal 502s if MCP restarted.

## Rules

- **NO RESETS unless the user explicitly asks.** Deploys never reset data. A database reset (`scripts/reset-db-aks.sh`) is a separate, deliberate operation that requires the user to have literally asked for a wipe in the current conversation — "deploy", "redeploy", "update the cluster", or an orchestration-version change is NOT such a request. When an orchestration change would benefit from a reset, say so and stop; do not run one.
- Never deploy without explicit user permission.
- Never skip the reset warning when orchestration behavior changed.
- Never assume a missing local env var means the live cluster already dropped that provider.
- Prefer repo scripts over handcrafted one-off deploy sequences.
