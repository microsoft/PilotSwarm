# PilotSwarm Release

Use this skill when a user wants to prepare or cut a release of PilotSwarm.

Keep the workflow tight and deterministic. The goal is to verify what will ship, fix release blockers, and only then commit, push, tag, and publish.

## Mandatory Main-Branch Release Invariant

Every **full release** must land as exactly one new squash commit on `main` relative to the pre-release `origin/main` tip. The annotated release tag and GitHub Release must target that pushed main commit.

- A commit or tag on a feature/release-prep branch is not a completed release.
- Pushing the source branch does not satisfy the main-branch requirement.
- Never publish the GitHub Release before `origin/main` points at the squash commit.
- Do not rewrite an already-published tag to repair this after the fact. Prevent the mismatch before publication.
- Preparation-only requests may stop before the squash commit, but a user request to cut/publish a full release includes the squash-to-main step when commit/push/tag permission is explicit.

Treat this as a `pilotswarm`-repo maintainer workflow only. Do not update downstream consumers, sample app forks outside this repo, or vendored PilotSwarm copies in other repositories unless the user explicitly asks for that separate follow-up.

## Release Workflow

1. Inspect the release surface.
   - Run `git status --short`.
   - Check changed runtime, docs, templates, examples, and workflow files.
   - Check the latest existing git tag with `git tag --sort=-version:refname | head`.
   - Check current package names and versions in `packages/sdk/package.json`, `packages/horizon-store/package.json`, and `packages/app/package.json`.
   - Report the current latest tag and the proposed next tag to the user before any tag is created.
   - Check whether each published workspace package has its own `README.md`.
   - Record the pre-release `origin/main` commit. Determine whether the current work is already on `main` or must be squashed from a source branch.

2. Verify feature-completeness around the change.
   - If behavior changed, confirm the canonical docs in `docs/` were updated.
   - Confirm the DevOps sample in `examples/devops-command-center/` still reflects the shipped behavior.
   - Confirm relevant builder templates in `templates/builder-agents/` were updated when builder-facing behavior changed.
   - Confirm `.github/copilot-instructions.md` was updated if contributor workflow or maintenance expectations changed.
   - **Update `CHANGELOG.md`** with a new top entry for the proposed version, dated, summarizing what shipped (SDK / Portal / TUI / Tests / Maintainer Workflow / npm sections as appropriate). The CHANGELOG entry is a release blocker, not optional.
   - **Update the repo-root `README.md` banner line** that calls out the latest version (e.g. `**v0.1.X** — ...`) so the repo landing page matches the version about to ship.

3. Run build and full test suite.
   - Start with `npm run build`.
   - Run the **full** local integration test suite before any release:
     ```bash
     ./scripts/run-tests.sh
     ```
     All suites must pass. Do not skip suites or accept partial runs for an official release.
    - If the full suite fails, identify the specific failing test files and rerun those failing tests sequentially a few times, for example:
       ```bash
       ./scripts/run-tests.sh --sequential <suite-name>
       ```
       or run the specific file directly with `npx vitest run <path-to-test>`.
    - If the previously failing tests pass repeatedly in sequential mode, treat the failure as a parallel-run flake in the test harness and continue with the release. Call this out explicitly in the release notes.
   - If a test fails, investigate and fix the root cause. Do not silence failures or weaken assertions to proceed.
    - If package contents matter, run:
     ```bash
     npm pack --dry-run
     ```
       from `packages/sdk`, `packages/horizon-store`, and `packages/app`.

4. Validate npm-release wiring.
   - Check `.github/workflows/publish-npm.yml`.
   - Check `.github/workflows/publish-starter-docker.yml` if the starter appliance or Docker release path changed.
   - Read the actual starter workflow trigger before discussing opt-in. The
     current workflow has `release: types: [published]` with no opt-out, so
     publishing a GitHub Release necessarily starts the starter-image job. Do
     not offer a yes/no choice that the workflow cannot honor. If the user does
     not want a starter image, stop before publishing the Release and change
     the workflow contract first; ask for a choice only when the wiring really
     supports one.
   - Confirm publish targets, access level, provenance flags, and required secrets still match the intended release.
   - Confirm each published package has correct `repository`, `homepage`, and `bugs` metadata for npm provenance verification.
   - Confirm built-in PilotSwarm plugins that must ship with the SDK are included by package `files` config.
   - Confirm package-local `README.md` files are actually present in `npm pack --dry-run` output for each workspace package.
   - If package names, publish workflow wiring, Docker publish wiring, or npm metadata changed, run the relevant CI workflow in dry-run or manual mode from `main` before tagging a real release when practical.

5. Prepare release notes for the user.
   - Summarize what changed.
   - List what was verified.
   - State the current latest git tag and the proposed next tag.
   - State whether publishing the GitHub Release will trigger the starter
     Docker workflow. With the current wiring it always does; surface that fact
     before publication rather than presenting it as optional.
   - Call out blockers or skipped checks explicitly.

6. Squash the release onto `main` and push only with explicit user approval.
   - Use non-interactive git commands.
   - Do not amend unless the user explicitly asks.
   - Preserve unrelated working-tree edits before switching branches and restore them afterward.
   - If the release was prepared on a feature/release branch:
     1. make the release-ready source tree coherent, including all intended tracked and untracked files;
     2. fetch `origin/main` and verify there is no unexpected remote-main drift;
     3. switch to local `main` at `origin/main`;
     4. run `git merge --squash <source-branch>`;
     5. verify the staged tree is byte-identical to the reviewed release-ready source tree;
     6. create one release commit on `main`.
   - If release preparation happened directly on `main`, ensure all release changes become one commit relative to the recorded pre-release `origin/main` tip. Do not leave multiple release-prep commits on main.
   - Prefer a commit message that describes the release-ready outcome, not just one file.
   - Push `main`, then verify `git rev-parse main` equals `git ls-remote origin refs/heads/main`.

7. Tag and publish only with explicit user approval.
   - Confirm the current commit is the pushed `origin/main` tip.
   - Create the annotated release tag from that exact main commit, then push the tag.
   - Verify local `main`, remote `origin/main`, and `git rev-parse <tag>^{}` are the same SHA.
   - Create a **GitHub Release** from the tag using `gh release create`. The npm publish workflow (`publish-npm.yml`) triggers on `release: [published]`, **not** on tag push alone. Without a GitHub Release, the publish will not run.
   - With the current wiring, the same GitHub Release unconditionally triggers
     `.github/workflows/publish-starter-docker.yml`. If that is not desired,
     the workflow must be changed before this step; there is no release-time
     opt-out input.
   - Include a concise release notes summary in the GitHub Release body.
   - If a manual workflow dispatch is used instead, report the exact inputs used.

8. Verify publication.
   - Check that the GitHub Actions publish workflow started and completed using `gh run list --workflow=publish-npm.yml`.
   - Report the published package names and versions.
   - Verify the exact coordinate, not only the mutable `latest` tag:
     `npm view <package>@<version> version`. On the managed corporate network,
     local npm metadata may be stale or hang even with an explicit public
     registry. If that happens, run the same exact-coordinate checks in an
     Azure-hosted container (for example `az acr run` with `node:24-alpine`)
     and report the local-network discrepancy; do not misclassify cached
     `latest` output as a failed publish.
   - Wait for the `Attach package tarballs to the Release` job and verify the
     GitHub Release contains `pilotswarm-sdk-<version>.tgz`,
     `pilotswarm-horizon-store-<version>.tgz`, and
     `pilotswarm-<version>.tgz`. When an accompanying AKS rollout must consume
     released packages rather than workspace source, hand these assets to the
     `pilotswarm-aks-deploy` skill's release-tarball path; do not build the
     deployment candidate before the assets exist.
   - If the release included the starter Docker image, also verify the published image tags directly with:
     ```bash
     docker buildx imagetools inspect docker.io/<user>/pilotswarm-starter:<tag>
     ```
     Confirm at least the release tag, bare version tag, and `latest` resolve successfully.
   - If publish failed, surface the workflow error rather than guessing.

## Current Package Surface

PilotSwarm publishes exactly three packages (in dependency/publish order):

1. `pilotswarm-sdk` — SDK runtime. Self-contained: the isomorphic Web API
   wire client ships inside it as the browser-safe subpath export
   `pilotswarm-sdk/api` (no separate api-client package exists).
2. `pilotswarm-horizon-store` — optional HorizonDB enhanced facts + graph
   providers (peer-depends on sdk).
3. `pilotswarm` — the application package (`packages/app`): terminal UI,
   portal server + Web API, and MCP server in one install. Bins:
   `pilotswarm`, `pilotswarm-cli` (alias), `pilotswarm-web`, `pilotswarm-mcp`.
   The former ui-core/ui-react/host layers ship inside it as subpath exports
   (`pilotswarm/ui-core`, `pilotswarm/ui-react`, `pilotswarm/host`,
   `pilotswarm/web`); there are no bundledDependencies and no prepack sync
   hacks.

Retired npm names (do NOT publish new versions): `pilotswarm-cli`,
`pilotswarm-web`, `pilotswarm-api-client`, `pilotswarm-mcp-server`. The first
two have old versions on the registry — deprecation notices pointing at
`pilotswarm` are the correct follow-up, not new releases.

If package names change later, update this skill in the same change.

## Notes

- Prefer fixing brittle tests over loosening product behavior just to get green.
- If a test failure is caused by stale hardcoded assumptions such as old model names, update the test to follow the current repo contract.
- npm package pages for workspace publishes come from the workspace-local `README.md`, not the repo-root README.
- When provenance is enabled for npm publish, mismatched or missing repository metadata is a release blocker, not a cosmetic issue.
- Treat the release agent as a maintainer workflow for this repository, not as an app-builder template.
