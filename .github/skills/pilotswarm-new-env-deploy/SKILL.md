# PilotSwarm New-Environment Deploy

Use this skill when the user wants a **brand-new, isolated** PilotSwarm
environment (e.g. `mysandbox`, `myenv2`) into a fresh resource group
— not when they are operating an already-deployed PilotSwarm cluster.

For the **legacy** path (`scripts/deploy-aks.sh`,
`scripts/deploy-portal.sh`, `deploy/k8s/**`), use the existing
`pilotswarm-aks-deploy` skill instead. Do not mix paths. The two
orchestrators operate on disjoint resource groups, identities, and
manifests.

## Canonical References

Always treat these as source of truth — `deploy/scripts/README.md` is
updated in lockstep with the code, this skill is a procedural overlay:

- `deploy/scripts/README.md` — full orchestrator reference (services, steps, EDGE_MODE × TLS_SOURCE, troubleshooting).
- `deploy/envs/template.env` — every operator-settable env key with inline documentation.
- `deploy/scripts/new-env.mjs` — scaffolder; declarative `INPUTS` array is the canonical CLI flag/prompt source.
- `deploy/scripts/deploy.mjs` — orchestrator; canonical step matrix, `--force` / `--force-module`, `UNSUPPORTED_COMBOS`.
- `deploy/services/*/deploy.json` + `deploy/services/deploy-manifest.json` — service catalog + module wiring.

## Pre-flight Checklist

Run through every item before running `new-env`:

- **Tooling**: Node ≥ 20, `az`, `docker`, `oras`, `kubectl`, `flux`. The orchestrator validates lazily per `--steps`, but `all` needs all of them.
- **Azure sign-in**: `az login --tenant <tenant-id>` then `az account set --subscription <sub-id>`. Mismatch is rejected by the tenant/subscription pin guard before any mutation.
- **Protected-name collision**: the chosen env name `X` derives `psX` as the resource-name prefix. The reserved names `dev` and `prod` (enterprise ServiceGroup labels) are NOT valid OSS env names. The scaffolder fails-closed if a derived name would collide with a protected literal; pick a different `X`.

## Step 0 — Decide auth posture FIRST

Before opening the defaults table, settle the portal-auth question. The
answer determines whether `PORTAL_AUTH_ENTRA_CLIENT_ID` is "user
provides it" or "we produce it via a pre-step" — and the user must
know that before they see the table.

Ask, in order:

1. **"Do you want browser sign-in (Entra) on this stamp, or an open
   sandbox?"**
   - `none` → `PORTAL_AUTH_PROVIDER=none`, no app-registration step.
     Skip the rest of Step 0.
   - `entra` → continue.
2. **"Do you already have a `PORTAL_AUTH_ENTRA_CLIENT_ID` (an existing
   Entra app registration), or shall I provision one for this stamp?"**
   - **Each stamp gets its own dedicated Entra app — always provision
     a new one.** One app per stamp keeps redirect URI lists clean,
     lets each environment be retired (and its app deleted)
     independently, and avoids the "shared app blast radius" where
     revoking one stamp's access touches every other stamp on the
     same client id.
   - **Never auto-suggest copying `PORTAL_AUTH_ENTRA_CLIENT_ID` from a
     sibling stamp's `.env` file.** Even when a previous local stamp
     (e.g. `<stamp>/.env`) shows a working client id, that app is
     bound to that stamp's lifecycle and redirect URIs. Pulling
     non-auth values (subscription, tenant, region) from a reference
     stamp is fine; pulling the client id is not.
   - The only valid path is: invoke the `pilotswarm-portal-app-reg`
     skill **before** Step 1 to provision a fresh app. That skill
     produces the `clientId` and writes it to
     `deploy/envs/local/<stamp>/entra-app.json`. The skill requires
     `-ServiceTreeId` — ask the user for theirs before invoking; do
     not invent a placeholder.
   - The only exception is if the user **explicitly and unprompted**
     asks to reuse a specific existing app (e.g. tenant policy makes
     app creation expensive, or they want a single SSO consent prompt
     across all dev stamps). In that case take the client id directly
     from them, or invoke the skill in append mode
     (`-ExistingAppId <appId> -EnvName <stamp>`). Do not infer this
     intent from the presence of a sibling stamp.
3. **"Should sign-in be locked down to assigned users only, or open to
   any tenant member?"** (only when `entra` and provisioning new)
   - **Production stamp (recommended)** → `-CreateAppRoles` + assign
     users/groups to the `admin` / `user` roles in Entra (via
     `Set-PortalAuthAssignments.ps1` or "Enterprise applications > Users
     and groups"). The role assignment list **is** the allowlist — no
     env-var allowlist needed. The portal engine is deny-by-default
     (since v0.1.33): assigned principals get `admin` / `user` from
     the JWT `roles` claim; unassigned signed-in users are denied at
     the portal layer. Leave `appRoleAssignmentRequired=false` unless
     a tenant admin can pre-grant OIDC scopes — flipping it on trips
     AADSTS90094 admin-consent in restricted tenants.
   - **Sandbox / dev stamp** → omit `-CreateAppRoles` AND set
     `PORTAL_AUTHZ_DEFAULT_ROLE=user` in the stamp's `.env` to
     explicitly opt into the legacy open posture (any tenant user signs
     in as `user`). The default `PORTAL_AUTHZ_DEFAULT_ROLE=none` will
     deny everyone for a no-allowlist, no-roles stamp.
   - **Legacy email allowlist (no roles)** → omit `-CreateAppRoles`
     and populate `PORTAL_AUTHZ_ADMIN_GROUPS` / `PORTAL_AUTHZ_USER_GROUPS`
     in the stamp's `.env`. The engine consults these allowlists only
     when the JWT carries no `roles[]` claim, so this posture is for
     stamps that don't want to do per-stamp Entra role assignments.

Order matters operationally:

- **Best path (preferred):** run app-reg BEFORE `new-env`. The script
  can create the app shell with an empty redirect URI list, you scaffold
  the stamp with the resulting client id already in place, then after
  the bicep step you re-run the wrapper with `-ExistingAppId` to add
  the now-known AFD endpoint.
- **Acceptable path:** scaffold with `PORTAL_AUTH_PROVIDER=none`, deploy
  to get the AFD endpoint, then run the wrapper with `-EnvName` for
  auto-discovery, then flip provider to `entra` in
  `deploy/envs/local/<stamp>/.env` and re-run `deploy.mjs portal <stamp> --steps manifests,rollout`.

Pick one explicitly with the user; do not silently improvise.

## Step 1 — Discover environment defaults

Before opening the dialogue, run a quick discovery so the user sees
**real values**, not placeholders:

```bash
az account show --query "{sub:id, subName:name, user:user.name, tenant:tenantId}" -o json
gh auth status      # confirms a token is available for GITHUB_TOKEN
```

Cache the result for the rest of the conversation. Surface:
- `sub` + `subName` → default `--subscription`
- `tenant` → default `PORTAL_AUTH_ENTRA_TENANT_ID` (whatever `az account show` returns)
- `user` (UPN) → **suggested** `ACME_EMAIL`, but **always** ask the
  user to confirm or override before using it. The UPN may not be the
  right address for cert-renewal notices (shared mailbox preferred for
  prod). For Roles posture, also suggest the UPN as the initial
  `ADMIN_ASSIGNMENTS` entry (the principal that will be assigned to
  the `admin` app role). Do **not** auto-suggest the UPN for
  `PORTAL_AUTHZ_ADMIN_GROUPS` — that env var is only relevant in the
  **Legacy email allowlist** posture, not the Roles posture.
- `gh` status → if logged in, offer to run `gh auth token` to populate
  `GITHUB_TOKEN`; if not, default it to empty (sentinel)

## Step 2 — Present the full input surface upfront

Always show the **entire** input surface in a single table — not just
name/location/edge-mode. The user must be able to confirm or override
every value before the script runs, so a non-interactive run is just as
safe as an interactive walk.

Group the table into four blocks: **Core**, **Edge/TLS**, **Per-stamp
secrets**, **Portal auth**. Mark each value `(default)`,
`(discovered)`, or `(required)`:

```
Core
  name                          <required>          # /^[a-z][a-z0-9]{0,11}$/, not dev|prod
  subscription                  <discovered: ${sub} — ${subName}>
  location                      westus3 (default)
  region-short                  <derived from deploy-manifest.json>
  foundry-enabled               n (default)         # n | y; when 'y', also scaffolds foundry-deployments.json

Edge / TLS
  edge-mode                     afd (default)         # afd | private
  tls-source                    letsencrypt (default) # letsencrypt | akv | akv-selfsigned
  acme-email                    <suggested: ${user}; CONFIRM OR OVERRIDE> # only when tls-source=letsencrypt
  host                          portal (default)      # only when edge-mode=private
  private-dns-zone              <required>            # only when edge-mode=private

VPN (optional — only when user asks for VPN access / off-network ingress)
  vpn-enabled                   n (default)           # n | y; when 'y', auto-implies edge-mode=afd + tls-source=akv
  ssl-cert-domain-suffix        <required when tls-source=akv>  # DNS suffix whose AKV cert this stamp will serve (e.g. dev.contoso.example)
  vpn-client-address-pool       172.16.200.0/24 (default)       # must not overlap VNet 10.20.0.0/16
  vpn-aad-audience              c632b3df-fb67-4d84-bdcf-b95ad541b5c8 (default)  # current Azure VPN Client app; override only for legacy-audience tenants

Per-stamp secrets (Key Vault)
  GITHUB_TOKEN                  <offer `gh auth token`>  # optional; sentinel if empty
  AZURE_MODEL_ROUTER_KEY        <skip / sentinel>       # optional
  AZURE_FW_GLM5_KEY             <skip / sentinel>       # optional
  AZURE_KIMI_K25_KEY            <skip / sentinel>       # optional
  AZURE_OAI_KEY                 <skip / sentinel>       # optional
  AZURE_OSS_DB_KEY              <skip / sentinel>       # optional

Portal auth (ConfigMap) — fields depend on auth posture
  PORTAL_AUTH_PROVIDER          entra (default)
  PORTAL_AUTH_ENTRA_TENANT_ID   <discovered: ${tenant}>
  PORTAL_AUTH_ENTRA_CLIENT_ID   <required if provider=entra>   # app-reg client id
                                                               # see pilotswarm-portal-app-reg skill if you don't have one
  PORTAL_AUTH_ALLOW_UNAUTHENTICATED  false (default)
  PORTAL_AUTHZ_DEFAULT_ROLE          none (default — deny-by-default since v0.1.33)

  # If posture = Roles (recommended for prod; -CreateAppRoles set):
  PORTAL_AUTHZ_DEFAULT_ROLE          none (leave at default — deny-by-default)
  PORTAL_AUTHZ_ADMIN_GROUPS          <leave empty>                                # role claim is authoritative; env allowlist is bypassed
  PORTAL_AUTHZ_USER_GROUPS           <leave empty>
  PORTAL_AUTH_ENTRA_ADMIN_GROUPS     <empty> (default)                            # optional: Entra group object ids that map to admin
  PORTAL_AUTH_ENTRA_USER_GROUPS      <empty> (default)

  # If posture = Sandbox / open (no app roles, accept any tenant user):
  PORTAL_AUTHZ_DEFAULT_ROLE          user                                         # explicit opt-in to the legacy open posture
  PORTAL_AUTHZ_ADMIN_GROUPS          <empty>
  PORTAL_AUTHZ_USER_GROUPS           <empty>

  # If posture = Legacy email allowlist (no app roles, restrict by email):
  PORTAL_AUTHZ_DEFAULT_ROLE          none (leave at default)
  PORTAL_AUTHZ_ADMIN_GROUPS          <suggested: ${user}; CONFIRM OR OVERRIDE>   # comma-separated UPNs / emails
  PORTAL_AUTHZ_USER_GROUPS           <empty> (default)

  # App-role assignments (Roles posture only — not stored in .env, applied via Set-PortalAuthAssignments.ps1)
  ADMIN_ASSIGNMENTS                  <suggested: ${user}; CONFIRM OR OVERRIDE>   # UPNs / object ids / group display names, comma-separated
  USER_ASSIGNMENTS                   <empty>                                       # UPNs / object ids / group display names, comma-separated
```

**When the user asks for VPN access (e.g. "spin up a VPN-enabled env",
"I need off-network access", "trusted-bypass lane"):** populate the VPN
block above and **auto-fill `edge-mode=afd` + `tls-source=akv` as the
defaults** for the Edge/TLS block — these are the only values that pass
the VPN combo gate, so the user shouldn't have to discover that
separately. Then ask for `ssl-cert-domain-suffix` (the one new value the
agent cannot infer), confirm `vpn-client-address-pool` (default is fine
unless their corp VPN already uses 172.16.200.0/24), and leave
`vpn-aad-audience` at the default unless they explicitly mention legacy
VPN client builds. Surface the 45-min provisioning lead time and the
tenant-admin Conditional Access requirement (see §"Optional: VPN
Gateway P2S" for both) *before* invoking the scaffolder, not after.

**Pick one mechanism per stamp; don't mix roles + email allowlist.**
The portal authz engine treats the JWT `roles` claim as authoritative
when present (see `packages/app/web/auth/authz/engine.js`): the
role-authoritative branch ignores `PORTAL_AUTHZ_ADMIN_GROUPS` /
`PORTAL_AUTHZ_USER_GROUPS` entirely when `roles[]` is non-empty. So
for Roles posture, the env allowlists serve no purpose — the role
assignment in Entra **is** the allowlist. The deny-by-default behavior
(`PORTAL_AUTHZ_DEFAULT_ROLE=none`, the new default) catches any
signed-in principal who has no role claim and no email match. For
sandbox stamps, set `PORTAL_AUTHZ_DEFAULT_ROLE=user` to opt back into
the open posture explicitly.

**About `ADMIN_ASSIGNMENTS` / `USER_ASSIGNMENTS`:** these are *not*
stored in `.env`. They are the principal list to feed into
`Set-PortalAuthAssignments.ps1` after the app reg exists. The deployer
agent collects them at table-confirmation time and invokes the
[`pilotswarm-portal-auth-assignments`](../pilotswarm-portal-auth-assignments/SKILL.md)
skill right after the app-reg pre-step. Default the admin list to the
deploying user (UPN from `az account show`); the user can edit either
list — add a colleague, swap to a security group, etc. Without at
least one admin assignment, an `-AssignmentRequired` app is unreachable.

State the mode explicitly to the user once the table is on screen.
Two safe modes exist; pick deliberately:

- **Agent-driven default: non-interactive + post-scaffold edit.** When
  *you* (the agent) are driving, prefer this even for hands-on
  sessions. The user has already confirmed every value in the table
  above, so the prompts add nothing — and the readline-echo trap (see
  Step 3a) makes pacing errors invisible until you grep the rendered
  `.env`. Scaffold with the flag-backed values, then use `edit` to
  populate the remaining keys.
- **User-driven interactive walk.** Only when the user explicitly
  asks to type values themselves (e.g. they want to paste secrets
  directly without sharing them with the agent). The agent's role
  there is to launch the process and stay out of stdin.

## Step 3 — Invoke

Always invoke via `node` directly when passing any flag — npm strips
`--location` (its own config flag) and `--prefix`:

```bash
node deploy/scripts/new-env.mjs <name>            # interactive
node deploy/scripts/new-env.mjs <name> \          # non-interactive
  --subscription <id> --location <loc> \
  --edge-mode <mode> --tls-source <src> [--acme-email <addr>]
```

The bare `npm run deploy:new-env` (no flags) form is fine for an
interactive walk. As soon as you need to pass any flag, drop to `node`
directly.

For `tls-source=letsencrypt`, `--acme-email` is mandatory in
non-interactive mode — without it the rendered `.env` has an empty
`ACME_EMAIL` and `deploy.mjs` will refuse the env at the overlay-contract
gate. Pre-fill from the discovered UPN unless the user overrides.

Validate the EDGE_MODE × TLS_SOURCE combination against the supported matrix before running anything (see Step 4 below). The combos `afd+akv-selfsigned` and `private+letsencrypt` are rejected by `deploy.mjs` itself — call them out before the user hits a `UNSUPPORTED_COMBOS` error.

Only proceed after explicit confirmation. The resource prefix written by the scaffolder is `ps<name>` (e.g. `psmysandbox-wus3-rg`, `psmysandboxglobal`).

If your first invocation form fails (e.g. you tried the `npm run deploy:new-env -- … --location …` form and npm stripped the flag), **re-confirm the mode with the user** before retrying with a different form. Do not silently switch from interactive to non-interactive — the prompt surface differs materially.

### Step 3a — Driving the prompts safely (agent-execution rules)

The interactive walk uses Node's `readline`, which **echoes typed input
on the same line as the current prompt**. When you drive it via
`write_powershell`, the transcript looks like
`PROMPT> <your-text-here>` even though `<your-text-here>` is the answer
to the *next* prompt that printed below. This makes input-pacing errors
catastrophically easy to misread — you cannot reliably tell from the
transcript alone which input was consumed by which prompt.

Two rules to avoid the trap:

1. **Prefer the hybrid path over a live interactive walk.** When the
   defaults table is fully confirmed up front, scaffold
   non-interactively (`name + --subscription + --location` + the
   edge/tls/acme flags) and then use `edit` to set the remaining
   `.env` keys (`GITHUB_TOKEN`, `AZURE_*_KEY`, `PORTAL_AUTH_*`,
   `PORTAL_AUTHZ_*`) directly. This skips the entire prompt sequence,
   removes the readline-echo ambiguity, and is materially safer than
   an LLM driving a stdin stream.

   **Sentinel-vs-empty trap (read this before editing).** The
   scaffolder writes `__PS_UNSET__` into `.env` for every
   `PORTAL_AUTH_*` / `PORTAL_AUTHZ_*` key the operator did not provide.
   That sentinel is **the correct way to express "unset at runtime"** —
   the portal runtime strips it from `process.env` at startup so the
   engine sees the key as absent (and applies its own default — e.g.
   `PORTAL_AUTHZ_DEFAULT_ROLE` falls through to `none` =
   deny-by-default). The deploy-time `substitute-env.mjs` gate treats
   **empty strings as "unresolved" and refuses to render manifests** —
   only the sentinel passes. When editing `.env`:
   - Replace `__PS_UNSET__` with a real value ONLY when you have one.
   - To leave a key "unset", leave the sentinel in place. **Do not
     replace `__PS_UNSET__` with an empty string** — that turns the
     deploy gate into a failure at the portal-manifests step.

2. **If you must drive interactively**, send **one answer per
   `write_powershell` call**, then `read_powershell` and confirm the
   *next* prompt has actually printed before sending the next answer.
   Never batch multiple `{enter}`-separated values in one call —
   readline coalesces them, but you lose the ability to verify which
   answer was consumed by which prompt. When in doubt, stop and grep
   the rendered `.env` before continuing.

### Step 3b — Verify the rendered .env before deploy

Regardless of mode, after `new-env` completes always grep the rendered
file and read the values back to the user:

```bash
grep -E '^(SUBSCRIPTION_ID|LOCATION|EDGE_MODE|TLS_SOURCE|ACME_EMAIL|PORTAL_AUTH_PROVIDER|PORTAL_AUTH_ENTRA_TENANT_ID|PORTAL_AUTH_ENTRA_CLIENT_ID|PORTAL_AUTHZ_DEFAULT_ROLE|PORTAL_AUTHZ_ADMIN_GROUPS|PORTAL_AUTHZ_USER_GROUPS)=' deploy/envs/local/<stamp>/.env
```

If any value looks wrong (especially `PORTAL_AUTHZ_DEFAULT_ROLE` not in
`{user, admin}` when you wanted an explicit value, `ACME_EMAIL` empty
when `TLS_SOURCE=letsencrypt`, `__PS_UNSET__` sentinels you didn't
intend to leave, or — symmetrically — `PORTAL_AUTH_*` / `PORTAL_AUTHZ_*`
keys that are empty strings where they should be `__PS_UNSET__`), fix
it with `edit` before invoking `deploy.mjs`.This check is mandatory after any
interactive run because of the readline-echo trap; it's cheap insurance
after non-interactive runs too.

## Step 4 — Edge mode × TLS source selection

| `EDGE_MODE` | `TLS_SOURCE` | `VPN_GATEWAY_ENABLED` | Supported? | When |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `afd` | `letsencrypt` | `false` | ✅ default | OSS-friendly public endpoint, ACME HTTP-01. |
| `afd` | `akv` | `false` | ✅ | Enterprise-internal OneCertV2-PublicCA cert via AKV. |
| `afd` | `akv` | `true` | ✅ | Hybrid AFD + VPN P2S (trusted-bypass for authenticated users not matched by the AFD WAF allow-list). AKV-only — see "Optional: VPN Gateway P2S" below. |
| `afd` | `akv-selfsigned` | any | ❌ | AppGw can't consume an AKV `Self` chain end-to-end. |
| `afd` | `letsencrypt` | `true` | ❌ | VPN path requires an AKV cert; ACME HTTP-01 cannot reach a VPN-only client. Preflight error: `vpn-requires-akv`. |
| `private` | `akv` | `false` | ✅ | Enterprise-internal OneCertV2-PrivateCA via AKV. |
| `private` | `akv-selfsigned` | `false` | ✅ | OSS-friendly private demo; AKV `Self`-issued cert. |
| `private` | `letsencrypt` | any | ❌ | ACME HTTP-01 cannot reach a private/ILB endpoint. |
| `private` | any | `true` | ❌ | VPN path is additive to AFD only (its WAF guard rules assume AFD as the public ingress). Preflight error: `vpn-requires-afd`. |

The orchestrator validates the combo against `UNSUPPORTED_COMBOS` in
`deploy.mjs` and `validateVpnGatewayCombo()` in
`deploy/scripts/lib/overlay-contracts.mjs` before any Bicep runs.

### Optional: VPN Gateway P2S (hybrid AFD + VPN)

Tenant users with a valid Entra ID token can still be blocked at the
public edge by AFD WAF allow-lists that the operator configures
(typically service-tag, IP-range, or header-based rules that gate the
public ingress to a known managed-network population). Enabling
`VPN_GATEWAY_ENABLED=true` adds an Azure VPN Gateway (Point-to-Site,
OpenVPN, Microsoft Entra ID auth) that terminates at the same AppGw
private listener as the AFD path, with the same AKV cert — a
"trusted-bypass" lane to the same stamp for authenticated tenant users
who don't match the public allow-list (e.g. remote / off-network /
unmanaged-device users).

- **Constraints**: `EDGE_MODE=afd` is required (code: `vpn-requires-afd`).
  `validateVpnGatewayCombo()` accepts any AKV-family `TLS_SOURCE` (`akv`
  or `akv-selfsigned`; code: `vpn-requires-akv`); however,
  `akv-selfsigned` is also rejected on AFD stamps end-to-end by
  `deploy.mjs` `UNSUPPORTED_COMBOS`, so the only effective combo for the
  trusted-bypass is `TLS_SOURCE=akv`. `letsencrypt` is rejected because
  ACME HTTP-01 cannot reach a VPN-only client.
  `SSL_CERT_DOMAIN_SUFFIX` must be set (the managed Private DNS zone
  uses it). The scaffolder prompts for it interactively when
  `TLS_SOURCE=akv`, or pass `--ssl-cert-domain-suffix <suffix>` for
  non-interactive runs (e.g. `--ssl-cert-domain-suffix
  dev.contoso.example`). `VPN_CLIENT_ADDRESS_POOL` must not overlap the VNet (default
  `10.20.0.0/16`). VPN uses the existing stamp `AZURE_TENANT_ID` — same
  Entra tenant as the rest of the deploy.
- **Cost / time**: ~$450/month total for `VpnGw2AZ` + Azure Private DNS Resolver inbound endpoint (~$280 gateway + PIP + ~$170 resolver). The Resolver is co-provisioned with the gateway so P2S clients can resolve Private DNS Zone records (e.g. portal hostname) through the tunnel without hosts-file edits.
  First-deploy time is **45+ minutes** (gateway provisioning is the long
  pole). Subsequent param changes are still measured in minutes.
- **AAD audience**: defaults to `c632b3df-fb67-4d84-bdcf-b95ad541b5c8`
  (current Microsoft-registered Azure VPN Client app). Set
  `VPN_AAD_AUDIENCE=41b23e61-6c1e-4545-b367-cd054e0ed4b4` in `.env` only on
  tenants that must interop with older Azure VPN client builds registered
  against the legacy audience.
- **Auto-seeded AppGw WAF guards**: when `VPN_GATEWAY_ENABLED=true` the
  base-infra bicep prepends three custom rules at priorities 90/91/92 to
  the AppGw WAF policy — `AllowAfd` (matches `X-Azure-FDID =
  <frontDoorId>`), `AllowVpn` (matches `RemoteAddr ∈
  VPN_CLIENT_ADDRESS_POOL`), and `BlockOther` (catch-all `Block`).
  Operator rules loaded from `APPGW_WAF_CUSTOM_RULES_FILE` (mirrors the
  AFD-side `WAF_CUSTOM_RULES_FILE`) MUST start at priority ≥ 100 — the
  90–92 band is reserved.

#### Setting up Conditional Access

Required out-of-band step before first VPN connect (tenant admin only).
Create one CA policy targeting the Azure VPN Client app
`c632b3df-fb67-4d84-bdcf-b95ad541b5c8` (or the legacy
`41b23e61-6c1e-4545-b367-cd054e0ed4b4` if you set the override above),
assigned to a NAMED users group (do not target "all users"), with the
grant control set to **require MFA**. Explicitly do **NOT** require device
compliance — the VPN client cannot satisfy that grant and the connect
attempt will fail with an opaque AAD error. The post-scaffold reminder
block in `new-env.mjs` re-prints these requirements when `VPN_GATEWAY_ENABLED=true`.

#### Distributing the VPN client profile

After the first deploy completes, hand operators the OpenVPN client
profile. Preferred path is the repo helper:
`pwsh -File deploy/scripts/auth/Get-VpnClientProfile.ps1 -EnvName <stamp>`
(see the `pilotswarm-vpn-client-profile` skill). It wraps
`az network vnet-gateway vpn-client generate --authentication-method EAPTLS`,
downloads the signed zip, and extracts it under the gitignored
`deploy/envs/local/<stamp>/vpn-client/` folder. As fallbacks: the Azure
portal — `Resource group → <gateway-name> → Point-to-site configuration →
Download VPN client` — or the raw CLI `az network vnet-gateway vpn-client
generate --resource-group <rg> --name <gateway-name>
--authentication-method EAPTLS`. All three emit the same `.zip` that
imports directly into the Azure VPN Client app (Windows / macOS / iOS /
Android).

## Step 5 — Deploy

End-to-end bring-up:

```bash
npm run deploy -- all <name>
```

The `all` aggregate runs the canonical sequence filtered by EDGE_MODE ×
TLS_SOURCE:

```
global-infra → base-infra → pls-anchor → cert-manager → cert-manager-issuers → worker-t3 → worker → portal
```

- `global-infra` and `pls-anchor` skip when `EDGE_MODE != afd`.
- `cert-manager` and `cert-manager-issuers` skip when `TLS_SOURCE != letsencrypt`.

Bicep outputs (ACR login server, storage account name, KV name, etc.)
cascade forward across services via the alias map; you don't hand-thread
anything between services.

### Per-service redeploys

| Use case | Command |
|---|---|
| Push portal code change | `npm run deploy -- portal <name> --steps build,push,manifests,rollout` |
| Worker env-only change | `npm run deploy -- worker <name> --steps manifests,rollout` |
| Re-apply BaseInfra Bicep only | `npm run deploy -- base-infra <name> --steps bicep` |
| Just T3 cluster | `npm run deploy -- worker-t3 <name>` |
| Force AppGw cert refresh after AKV cert rotation | `npm run deploy -- portal <name> --force-module portal --steps bicep` |
| Validate without deploying | `npm run deploy -- <svc> <name> --steps noop` |

`--steps` accepts any subset in any order; it re-sorts to canonical
pipeline order (`build → bicep → seed-secrets → push → manifests →
rollout`). Outside `all` mode, single-service runs also redeploy that
service's Bicep dependencies — the deploy-marker (template+params hash)
short-circuits unchanged modules so this is cheap.

### Force semantics

- `--force`: bypass deploy-markers for **every** Bicep module in scope. Use sparingly.
- `--force-module <name>`: bypass the deploy-marker for one module only (repeatable). The preferred lever — minimum-blast-radius. Empty values are rejected at parse time.

## Step 6 — Verify

After a successful `all`:

```bash
# Bicep outputs cached per env — sanity-check the names.
jq -r 'to_entries | .[] | "\(.key)=\(.value.value)"' \
  deploy/.tmp/<name>/bicep-outputs.cache.json | sort

# T2 control cluster — workers and portal should be Running.
kubectl --context ps<name>-aks get pods -n pilotswarm

# T3 worker cluster — repo-cache StatefulSet should be Ready.
kubectl --context ps<name>-aks-t3 get statefulset,pvc,pod,svc -n pilotswarm-jobs

# Portal health (substitute the AFD endpoint or private FQDN).
curl -s https://<portal-fqdn>/api/health
# → {"ok":true,...}
```

(Adjust namespace names if your deploy manifests use different defaults
— check `deploy/services/portal/deploy.json` and
`deploy/services/worker/deploy.json` for the rendered namespace.)

If Flux returns 403 on the first `rollout`, the cross-cluster RBAC grant
on T3 (or Flux's Storage Blob Data Reader on T2) hasn't propagated. Retry
`--steps rollout` after ~30s. If persistent, see the Flux troubleshooting
section in `deploy/scripts/README.md`.

## Step 7 — Teardown

`deploy.mjs` is deploy-only. Tear down via Azure CLI:

```bash
az group delete --name ps<name>-<region>-rg --yes --no-wait
az group delete --name ps<name>global --yes --no-wait   # afd mode only
```

The protected-resource guardrail does **not** block operator-driven
deletion of envs you created; it only blocks `deploy.mjs` from
*targeting* live resources.

If the Entra app reg was created by `pilotswarm-portal-app-reg`,
delete it too:

```bash
az ad app delete --id $(jq -r .clientId deploy/envs/local/<name>/entra-app.json)
```

## Guardrails

- **Never run `deploy.mjs` against a live cluster.** It is a separate path. If the user wants to push to live, use `scripts/deploy-aks.sh --skip-reset` / `scripts/deploy-portal.sh` and the `pilotswarm-aks-deploy` skill.
- **Protected-names check is non-negotiable.** If the scaffolder rejects a name, do not work around it. The check fires on both raw inputs and derived names.
- **Tenant/subscription pin is non-negotiable.** `az account show` must match the env file's `AZURE_TENANT_ID` and `SUBSCRIPTION_ID` before any mutation.
- **Bicep deploy-markers are cached at `deploy/.tmp/<name>/`** — wiping `.tmp/<name>/` forces full redeploys on the next run (occasionally useful for re-running a broken intermediate step, but slow).
- **Don't propagate changes into downstream consumers.** PilotSwarm changes operate on PilotSwarm only — don't roll them into downstream app repos that vendor or consume the SDK unless the user explicitly asks.

## Common Pitfalls

- **`--force-module=`** with empty value: rejected at parse time (good — it would otherwise silently push an empty string and force nothing).
- **AppGw SSL-cert not refreshing after AKV rotation**: deploy-marker skipped the portal module. Use `npm run deploy -- portal <env> --force-module portal --steps bicep`.
- **AFD Private Endpoint approval times out**: `approve-private-endpoint.bicep` polls for up to 10 minutes. If it still times out, check `az network private-endpoint-connection list` on the PLS for stuck Pending entries.
- **DNS prop delays on AFD**: AFD endpoint propagation can take 5–15 minutes after `global-infra`. Don't assume the curl works immediately after `all` returns; retry over ~15 minutes. During that window, `curl https://<afd-host>/api/health` will return HTTP 404 with an `x-azure-ref` header — this is normal, not a failure.
- **Portal sign-in loop after deploy**: redirect URI on the Entra app reg doesn't match the deployed AFD endpoint. Run `az ad app show --id <clientId> --query "spa.redirectUris"` and compare. If the app was created before the AFD endpoint was known, re-run `pilotswarm-portal-app-reg` in `-ExistingAppId` append mode.

## Boundary with sibling skills

| Question | Skill |
|---|---|
| "Set up a new sandbox env" | **this skill** (`deploy.mjs`) |
| "Roll out a fix to the existing legacy cluster" | `pilotswarm-aks-deploy` (`deploy-aks.sh`) |
| "Reset / wipe DB on the existing cluster" | `pilotswarm-aks-reset` |
| "Force AppGw cert refresh in my sandbox" | **this skill** (`--force-module portal`) |
| "Provision Entra app reg for a portal stamp" | `pilotswarm-portal-app-reg` |
| "Add a new module to the deploy" | both — the orchestrator (`deploy.mjs` services-manifest) is shaped by this skill; legacy k8s manifests live in `pilotswarm-aks-deploy` territory |
