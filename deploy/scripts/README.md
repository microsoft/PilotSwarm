# OSS Node deploy orchestrator (`deploy/scripts/`)

A multi-platform Node.js deploy driver for PilotSwarm on AKS that
**coexists with** — and never replaces — the existing paths:

| Path | What it is | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| `scripts/deploy-aks.sh` | Imperative bash script targeting an existing dev cluster (`docs/developer/deploy/aks.md`). | Engineer smoke loop on a one-off cluster. |
| _enterprise deployment orchestrator_ (internal-only) | Enterprise-driven GitOps deploy (Bicep + Kustomize + Flux Storage Bucket). | Production rollouts via the enterprise deployment path. |
| **`deploy/scripts/deploy.mjs`** *(this README)* | OSS-friendly equivalent of the enterprise path, runnable from any contributor's box without the enterprise path. | Reproducing the GitOps deploy locally; future GitHub Actions wrapper. |

Same outcome as the enterprise path: Bicep deployed → image pushed to ACR →
Kustomize manifests staged with `.env` substitution → tree uploaded to
the Flux Storage Bucket → rollout verified against the running cluster.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js ≥ 20** (already a repo dep — `node --version`)
- **Azure CLI** (`az login` against the target subscription)
- **Docker** (for `worker` / `portal` image builds; not required for `baseinfra` / `globalinfra`)
- **`oras`** ([install](https://oras.land/docs/installation)) — used to push the `docker save` tarball into ACR
- **`kubectl`** ([install](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)) — used by the `rollout` step
- **`flux`** ([install](https://fluxcd.io/flux/installation/#install-the-flux-cli)) — used by the `rollout` step to force-reconcile the Flux Bucket source + Kustomization against the just-uploaded blobs (`kubectl wait kustomization --for=condition=Ready` is unreliable here — see `deploy/scripts/lib/wait-rollout.mjs` for why)

CLI checks are **lazy**: each step only validates the tools it actually
needs, so `--steps bicep` works without `oras` / `docker` installed.

## Quickstart

There are two ways to point this script at a target subscription / cluster:

Every deploy targets a personal local env at
`deploy/envs/local/<name>/.env`, scaffolded by `npm run deploy:new-env`
from `deploy/envs/template.env`. The local file is standalone — no
runtime cascade — so editing the template never retroactively changes
existing envs.

```bash
# 1. Sign in and select the target subscription
az login
az account set --subscription "<subscription-id>"

# 2. Scaffold a personal env. Run interactively (prompts for env name,
#    subscription, location) or pass everything via flags. <name> must
#    match /^[a-z][a-z0-9]{0,11}$/.
npm run deploy:new-env
#    or non-interactive:
npm run deploy:new-env -- foo --subscription <id> --location westus3
#    The scaffolder generates RESOURCE_GROUP, GLOBAL_RESOURCE_PREFIX,
#    GLOBAL_RESOURCE_GROUP, PORTAL_RESOURCE_NAME using the same patterns
#    that the enterprise deployment manifests use:
#      RESOURCE_GROUP         = ${RESOURCE_PREFIX}-<regionShort>-rg
#      GLOBAL_RESOURCE_PREFIX = ${RESOURCE_PREFIX}global
#      GLOBAL_RESOURCE_GROUP  = ${GLOBAL_RESOURCE_PREFIX}

# 3. Deploy. Use the same env name passed to new-env.
npm run deploy -- all foo

# 4. Single-service / single-step deploys
npm run deploy -- worker foo
npm run deploy -- worker foo --steps build,push
npm run deploy -- baseinfra foo --steps bicep
```

The reserved labels `dev` and `prod` are NOT valid OSS env names — they
are used by the enterprise path for ServiceGroup naming.

### First-time bring-up (`all`)

For an end-to-end deploy on a fresh subscription / cluster, use the `all`
aggregate. It runs the canonical enterprise-equivalent sequence
(`globalinfra → baseinfra → worker → portal`) in a single invocation,
sharing the same env map across services so Bicep outputs (ACR login
server, deployment storage account, etc.) cascade forward automatically:

```bash
# Full bring-up (all infra + both services, default pipeline per service)
npm run deploy -- all foo

# Infra-only refresh across all services
npm run deploy -- all foo --steps bicep

# App-only redeploy (skips infra services automatically — their default
# pipeline doesn't include manifests/rollout, so the intersection is empty
# and they're logged as "no applicable steps")
npm run deploy -- all foo --steps manifests,rollout
```

In `all` mode each service's Bicep step deploys **only its own module** —
dependencies (e.g. BaseInfra) were already deployed by an earlier item
in the same invocation, so we don't redundantly re-apply them. Outside
of `all` mode, single-service invocations still redeploy their
dependencies (idempotent, but slower) so a one-off `worker foo` works
even if BaseInfra hasn't been refreshed in this shell.

The mapping `service → module(s)` is in
[`deploy/scripts/lib/service-info.mjs`](lib/service-info.mjs)
(`SERVICE_TO_MODULES` for single-service, `ALL_MODE_MODULES` for `all`).

The `package.json` wrapper exposes the same CLI:

```bash
npm run deploy -- worker foo --steps manifests
```

> **Note**: when invoking via `npm run deploy`, separate npm flags from
> deploy-script flags with `--`. Inside the scripts themselves the entry
> point is `deploy/scripts/deploy.mjs`; you can call `node` directly if
> you prefer (e.g. `node deploy/scripts/deploy.mjs worker foo`).

## CLI reference

```
npm run deploy -- <service> <env> [flags]

Services:  worker | portal | baseinfra | globalinfra | all
Envs:      a local env name created with `npm run deploy:new-env`

Flags:
  --steps <list>      build,bicep,push,manifests,rollout (or 'noop')
  --region <name>     Override LOCATION from <env>.env
  --image-tag <tag>   Default: <env>-<short-sha>[-dirty]
  --clean             Wipe deploy/.tmp/<service>-<env>/ before running
  --force             Ignore deploy markers; redeploy every Bicep module even
                      if its template + rendered params are unchanged
  --force-module <m>  Force-redeploy a single named Bicep module (e.g. portal,
                      pls-anchor). Repeatable. Lighter-touch than --force when
                      only one module needs to retry past its deploy marker
                      (e.g. recover from an out-of-band Bicep tweak or RBAC
                      propagation race).
  --help, -h
```

### Step matrix

| Step | What it does | Applies to |
|---|---|---|
| `noop` | Load env, run preflight (Azure login + subscription match), exit. | all |
| `build` | `docker build` the service image and `docker save` to a tarball under `deploy/.tmp/<svc>-<env>/`. | worker, portal |
| `push` | `oras cp` the tarball into the per-region ACR (no Docker daemon push). | worker, portal |
| `bicep` | Render `deploy/services/<Module>/bicep/<Module>.params.template.json` with `${VAR}` substitution from the env map, then `az deployment {sub|group} create`. Captures Bicep outputs back into the env map for downstream steps. | per-service module list |
| `seed-secrets` | Read seedable secrets (`GITHUB_TOKEN` + `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`) from the loaded env map (set by `new-env` in `deploy/envs/local/<name>/.env`), `az keyvault secret set` each into the env's KV (writing `__PS_UNSET__` for any left blank). SPC mounts them into the worker pod; the runtime strips sentinel values at startup. See [Secrets & identity](#secrets--identity-bicep-deploy-path-only). | baseinfra |
| `manifests` | Substitute the overlay `.env` using the env map, stage the rendered `gitops/<svc>/` tree under `deploy/.tmp/<svc>-<env>/`, then `az storage blob upload-batch` the **unrendered** Kustomize tree to the Flux Storage Bucket. Flux reconciles the cluster from there. Worker / cert-manager / cert-manager-issuers each use a single `overlays/default` overlay (per-env values flow in via the staged `.env`); Portal overlays are keyed by `${EDGE_MODE}-${TLS_SOURCE}` (`overlays/afd-letsencrypt`, `overlays/afd-akv`, `overlays/private-akv` — `akv-selfsigned` shares the `private-akv` overlay). | worker, portal |
| `rollout` | `flux reconcile kustomization <svc>-<svc> -n flux-system --with-source` (forces the Bucket source to re-pull the just-uploaded blobs and the Kustomization to apply that revision), then `kubectl rollout status deployment/<svc>` in `NAMESPACE`, then verifies live `image` ends with the expected tag. | worker, portal |

The default pipeline (no `--steps`) is the full chain. For `baseinfra`
and `globalinfra` the chain ends at `bicep` (no app artifacts to roll
out).

## Env-file schema

Every deploy targets a personal local env at `deploy/envs/local/<name>/.env`
(the entire `local/` directory is gitignored). Local env files are
**standalone** — `deploy.mjs` reads them directly with no runtime cascade
onto a shared base file.

`deploy/envs/template.env` is a checked-in template consumed only by the
scaffolder (`npm run deploy:new-env`): it copies the template, substitutes
deployment-target keys, prompts for per-stamp secrets, and writes the
complete file under `local/<name>/.env`. Subsequent edits to `template.env`
affect only newly-scaffolded envs — never existing ones.

`dev` and `prod` are reserved labels used by the enterprise path for ServiceGroup
naming; they are NOT valid OSS env names.

Files are flat `KEY=value`, no quoting, no shell expansion.

| Key | Used by | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `SUBSCRIPTION_ID` | preflight | Must match `az account show --query id`. |
| `LOCATION`, `RESOURCE_GROUP`, `RESOURCE_PREFIX` | bicep, manifests, rollout | Region + RG + Bicep `resourceNamePrefix`. |
| `GLOBAL_RESOURCE_GROUP`, `GLOBAL_RESOURCE_PREFIX` | bicep (globalinfra) | Front Door RG + prefix. |
| `PORTAL_RESOURCE_NAME` | bicep (portal) | Portal logical name. |
| `NAMESPACE` | manifests, rollout | Target Kubernetes namespace (`pilotswarm` per A-11). |
| `EDGE_MODE` | bicep, manifests, rollout | `afd` (default) or `private`. Controls AFD/AppGw/AGIC vs AKS web-app-routing addon. Drives Portal overlay path. |
| `TLS_SOURCE` | bicep, manifests | `letsencrypt` \| `akv` \| `akv-selfsigned`. Drives Portal overlay path and AKV cert issuer. See [docs/developer/deploy/aks.md](../../docs/developer/deploy/aks.md) for the supported `(EDGE_MODE × TLS_SOURCE)` combos. |
| `HOST`, `PRIVATE_DNS_ZONE` | bicep (portal), rollout (portal) | Required when `EDGE_MODE=private`. Bicep provisions the Private DNS Zone + VNet link; deploy.mjs writes the A record `${HOST}.${PRIVATE_DNS_ZONE}` → internal LB IP after Portal rollout. |
| `ACME_EMAIL` | bicep (cert-manager-issuers) | Required when `TLS_SOURCE=letsencrypt`. Let's Encrypt registration / renewal-failure notices. |
| `PORTAL_TLS_ISSUER_NAME` | bicep (portal) | Optional override for the AKV cert issuer name. Defaults to `OneCertV2-PublicCA` (afd) / `OneCertV2-PrivateCA` (private), auto-registered by Portal bicep. |
| `AZURE_TENANT_ID` | manifests | Workload identity federation tenant. |
| `PORTAL_HOSTNAME` | manifests (portal) | Public hostname for AFD origin. |
| `SSL_CERT_DOMAIN_SUFFIX`, `WAF_MODE`, `ACR_SKU`, `APP_GATEWAY_PRIVATE_IP` | bicep | Static infra params. |
| `IMAGE` | manifests | Auto-composed from `ACR_LOGIN_SERVER` + service image repo + `--image-tag`; do **not** seed manually. |

**Bicep outputs are never seeded.** `ACR_NAME`, `ACR_LOGIN_SERVER`, `KV_NAME`,
`AKS_CLUSTER_NAME`, `BLOB_CONTAINER_ENDPOINT`, `DEPLOYMENT_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME`,
`DEPLOYMENT_STORAGE_CONTAINER_NAME`, `WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_CLIENT_ID`,
`APPROVAL_MANAGED_IDENTITY_ID`, `FRONT_DOOR_*`, `APPLICATION_GATEWAY_NAME`,
`PRIVATE_LINK_CONFIGURATION_NAME`
all cascade into the env Map at runtime via the FR-022 alias map. A full
`node deploy.mjs all <env>` invocation handles this end-to-end. Standalone
split-step runs (e.g. `worker dev --steps manifests` without first running
`--steps bicep` in the same process) fail fast with a clear "unresolved
placeholder" error directing you to run a prior `--steps bicep`.

## How `.env` substitution works (vs. The enterprise path)

| | Enterprise path | OSS path |
|---|---|---|
| Source | `*.Configuration.json` per service | `deploy/envs/local/<name>/.env` (standalone, scaffolded from `deploy/envs/template.env`) |
| Scope binding | the enterprise orchestrator injects subscription / region / IDs into the parameters JSON | `deploy/scripts/lib/common.mjs` resolves env file → JS Map |
| `.env` substitution | the enterprise param-substitution helper rewrites overlay `.env` from JSON params | `deploy/scripts/lib/substitute-env.mjs` rewrites overlay `.env` from the env map |
| Per-service identity | Per-service scope binding | Shared `csiIdentity` UAMI clientId cascades from BaseInfra Bicep output → both worker and portal overlays |

Both paths produce the **same rendered overlay `.env`** before upload.
The Kustomize tree itself is uploaded **unrendered** — Flux runs
`kustomize build` in-cluster against the substituted `.env`.

If a key referenced by the overlay `.env` is not present in the env
map, the substitute step **fails closed** with a sorted list of missing
keys before any file is written.

## Bicep param flow

`deploy/services/<Module>/bicep/<Module>.params.template.json` files use
literal `${VAR}` placeholders. The `bicep` step:

2. Reads the template, substitutes `${VAR}` from the env map (via `render-params.mjs`).
2. Writes the rendered JSON under `deploy/.tmp/<svc>-<env>/params/`.
3. Runs `az deployment {sub|group} create` with `--parameters @<rendered>.json`.
4. Captures named outputs back into the env map (e.g. `acrLoginServer`, `kvName`) so later steps can consume them.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `Subscription mismatch` | `az account show` returns a different sub than `<env>.env`. | `az account set --subscription "<id>"`. |
| `Required CLI 'oras' not found` | `oras` not on PATH. | Install per [oras.land](https://oras.land/docs/installation). |
| `Missing keys for overlay .env: …` | `<env>.env` is missing keys that the overlay references. | Run `--steps bicep` first to populate Bicep-output keys in the same process. |
| `Live image tag mismatch` after rollout | `flux reconcile --with-source` returned but the Deployment still shows the prior image. | Re-run `--steps rollout`. If persistent, inspect with `kubectl describe kustomization/<svc>-<svc> -n flux-system` and `flux get sources bucket -n flux-system` to confirm the Bucket artifact revision and the Kustomization's `lastAppliedRevision` agree. |

## Tests

Stdlib-only unit tests cover the orchestrator's trickiest pieces (overlay
substitution rules, FR-022 Bicep-output alias map, deploy-marker hashing,
manifest publish atomicity, private-endpoint approval, and Dockerfile
lockfile enforcement).

```sh
npm run test:deploy-scripts
```

Test files live at `deploy/scripts/test/*.test.mjs` and run with the
built-in Node test runner (no new dependencies). The suite is gated on PRs
and pushes to `main` by `.github/workflows/deploy-scripts-tests.yml`
whenever `deploy/scripts/**`, `deploy/services/**/deploy.json`,
`deploy/services/**/bicep/**`, the worker/portal Dockerfiles, the root
package manifest/lockfile, or that workflow itself changes.

### Per-module redeploy controls

For one-off operator overrides, `--force-module <name>` on the deploy
orchestrator forces a single named module past its deploy marker for the
current invocation. Repeatable; lighter-touch than `--force` which
bypasses markers for every module.

### Manual verification protocol — private-endpoint approval

After landing the FR-015 hardening of
`deploy/services/common/bicep/approve-private-endpoint.bicep`, two
operator-driven checks should be run against a real AFD-fronted stamp:

1. **Idempotency**: re-run the deploy against an environment whose AFD
   private-endpoint is already Approved. The bicep deployment-script
   should exit 0 quickly via the idempotency pre-check (no polling). The
   portal module's deploy-marker matches on unchanged inputs, so the
   normal deploy is a no-op skip; use `--force-module portal` to actually
   re-run the approval bicep when verifying this.
2. **Minimum-role compatibility**: deploy from an identity holding only
   the documented minimum role assignment on the Application Gateway
   (Network Contributor scoped to the AppGw, no broader Reader). The
   `list_pe_connections` retry helper should not be exercised on the
   happy path; if it is, stderr will surface the underlying `az` error
   instead of being misclassified as "no pending connections".

If either check fails, the regression tests in `approve-pe.test.mjs`
should be extended to cover the new failure mode before re-attempting.

#### Note: AFD post-approval propagation delay

Approving the PE on the AppGw is necessary but **not sufficient** for the
AFD endpoint to start serving traffic. AFD does not continuously poll the
PE connection state — it only re-evaluates Private Link wiring as part
of each origin **deployment cycle**. If the PE is approved after AFD's
most recent cycle completed, AFD will not pick up the approval until its
next organic cycle, which the FAQ documents at
[**"up to 20 minutes" for a single configuration update**][afd-faq]
(back-to-back changes can extend to ~40 min). The Private Link how-to
adds: ["it can take a few minutes for the connection to be
established"][afd-pl-appgw] after approval. In practice we see
**15–30 minutes** end-to-end.

During that window the AFD endpoint returns AFD's default 404 HTML page
(consistent ~260 KB body, identical for `/`, `/api/health`, etc., with
an `x-azure-ref` response header). The AFD origin's
`sharedPrivateLinkResource.deploymentStatus` may also show `NotStarted`:
that field is a [documented read-only AFD edge-propagation state][afd-state-spec]
(values: `NotStarted`, `InProgress`, `Succeeded`, `Failed`), separate
from `provisioningState`, and it can persist as `NotStarted` even after
the endpoint becomes reachable — so it is not a reliable health signal.

Operator guidance:

- Confirm the PE on the AppGw shows `status=Approved,
  provisioningState=Succeeded`. If yes, the deploy did its job — wait.
- Re-test the AFD endpoint with `curl -i https://$AFD_HOSTNAME/api/health`
  after 15–30 minutes. A small-body `200` (no `x-azure-ref` header)
  confirms AFD has propagated.
- If still 404 after ~30 minutes, a no-op
  `az afd origin update … --enable-private-link true …` PUT against the
  origin re-triggers AFD's deployment cycle, which re-evaluates the
  now-Approved PE state. Re-running the bicep with `--force-module portal`
  is roughly equivalent.

## Secrets &amp; identity (bicep-deploy path only)

This deploy path uses **managed identity for Azure resources** and keeps
operator inputs in a single gitignored env file. Database and Blob
authentication can be selected independently.

> **Legacy `scripts/deploy-aks.sh` is unchanged.** It still builds the
> `copilot-runtime-secrets` K8s secret from local env vars
> (`DATABASE_URL`, `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING`,
> etc.) and the runtime falls through to legacy connection-string code
> paths because `PILOTSWARM_USE_MANAGED_IDENTITY` is unset.

### Per-env secrets file

`npm run deploy:new-env` prompts for the two seedable secrets and appends
them to `deploy/envs/local/<name>/.env` (gitignored — the entire
`deploy/envs/local/` directory is excluded by
`deploy/envs/.gitignore`). Seedable keys:

| Key | Why it's a secret | How it's used |
|---|---|---|
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | Optional. Human-issued PAT, cannot be created at deploy time. When blank, the deploy writes the `__PS_UNSET__` sentinel into KV; users supply their own per-user GitHub Copilot key via the Admin panel instead. | Synced to KV → mounted into worker pod via SPC as `github-token` |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Vendor-issued API key | Synced to KV → mounted as `anthropic-api-key` |
| `DATABASE_URL`, `PILOTSWARM_CMS_FACTS_DATABASE_URL` (BYO only) | External database connection URLs, which can contain passwords | Seeded into the stamp Key Vault and projected through a dedicated CSI Secret, never the BYO ConfigMap |

Everything else that used to live in K8s secrets is now either:
- **Config** (e.g. the legacy provisioned bootstrap `DATABASE_URL`, `AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_URL`,
  `KV_NAME`, `DEPLOYMENT_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME`) — sourced from Bicep
  outputs, surfaced via the worker `ConfigMap` in the rendered overlay; or
- **Acquired at runtime** via managed identity — Postgres AAD tokens
  for CMS+facts; Blob OAuth tokens for session blobs.

The `seed-secrets` step reads these keys from the loaded env map.
Optional model credentials receive the unset sentinel when blank.
For BYO databases it validates the supplied URLs or explicit secret
references before writing any secrets.
It runs **after** `bicep` (so the KV exists) and **before**
`manifests`/`rollout`.

### Independent database and Blob authentication

The bicep-deploy path enables MI mode by setting these in the overlay
`.env` (substituted into the worker `ConfigMap`):

| Key | Effect |
|---|---|
| `PILOTSWARM_USE_MANAGED_IDENTITY=1` | Database Entra auth. Set `0` for password-authenticated BYO databases. Legacy callers without a Blob-specific override still use this as a shared default. |
| `PILOTSWARM_BLOB_USE_MANAGED_IDENTITY=1` | Independent Blob auth; default on this deploy path, including older env files. Keep enabled when database auth is password-based. The deploy does not seed a Blob connection-string secret. |
| `AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_URL=https://<acct>.blob.core.windows.net/` | Worker constructs `BlobServiceClient(accountUrl, DefaultAzureCredential)`. SAS generation throws `NotSupportedInManagedIdentityMode` — artifact downloads must proxy through the worker. |
| `PILOTSWARM_CMS_FACTS_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://<aad-user>@<fqdn>:5432/<db>?sslmode=require` | Passwordless URL for CMS + facts pools. The factory installs an AAD token callback (`https://ossrdbms-aad.database.windows.net/.default`). |
| `PILOTSWARM_DB_AAD_USER=<csi-uami-display-name>` | Postgres AAD admin role name = CSI UAMI display name. Used to build `aadUser` in the factory. |
| `DATABASE_URL=postgresql://<bootstrap-pwd-user>:<pwd>@<fqdn>:5432/<db>` | Password URL kept available for the legacy `scripts/deploy-aks.sh` flow and as a fallback when MI is not configured. In MI mode the duroxide store ignores any password in this URL and authenticates via duroxide-node's native Entra path (`PostgresProvider.connectWithSchemaAndEntra`, duroxide-node ≥ 0.1.25). |

`deploy.mjs` composes `AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_URL` from the
`BLOB_CONTAINER_ENDPOINT` Bicep output, and composes
`PILOTSWARM_CMS_FACTS_DATABASE_URL` + `PILOTSWARM_DB_AAD_USER` from
`POSTGRES_FQDN` + `POSTGRES_AAD_ADMIN_PRINCIPAL_NAME`.

### Use an existing database (including HorizonDB)

Set `DEPLOY_POSTGRES=false` in `deploy/envs/local/<name>/.env`.
The supported `deploy.mjs` path skips the flexible-server module and ignores
stale `POSTGRES_*` cache entries. `true` is the default, including for older
env files with no key. Legacy `1` and `0` are accepted and serialized as
JSON booleans; other values fail. This is an explicit provisioning choice,
not inferred from a URL. Switching to `false` does **not** delete a server
from an earlier incremental deployment.

Shell overrides of the two database URLs apply only when
`DEPLOY_POSTGRES=false`, with a key-only warning. With provisioning enabled,
ambient shell URLs are ignored and warned about, even if the env file has
blank URL keys. Explicit file values and the existing stamp-URL composition
remain unchanged.

For a password-authenticated external database, set:

```dotenv
DEPLOY_POSTGRES=false
PILOTSWARM_USE_MANAGED_IDENTITY=0
PILOTSWARM_BLOB_USE_MANAGED_IDENTITY=1
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://<user>:<percent-encoded-password>@<host>:5432/<environment-db>?sslmode=require
PILOTSWARM_CMS_FACTS_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://<user>:<percent-encoded-password>@<host>:5432/<environment-db>?sslmode=require
```

For Entra auth, use passwordless URLs, set
`PILOTSWARM_USE_MANAGED_IDENTITY=1`, and set `PILOTSWARM_DB_AAD_USER` to
the principal registered on the external database. The deploy does not
create that external principal, configure the external firewall, or
provision the external database. Verify network access and provider/extension
compatibility separately. Use a distinct database and role per test
environment on a shared cluster; sharing a server must not mean sharing
PilotSwarm's tables.

The full `npm run deploy -- all <name>` pipeline seeds the two URLs into
the environment's Key Vault as `database-url` and
`pilotswarm-cms-facts-database-url`. Seeding uses a private temporary file
outside the manifest tree instead of putting credentials in CLI arguments.
The file is removed on success or failure, and CLI diagnostics are withheld
on failures because they may contain credentials. For split bring-up, run:

```sh
npm run deploy -- base-infra <name> --steps bicep,seed-secrets
npm run deploy -- worker <name>
npm run deploy -- portal <name>
```

Alternatively, populate secrets in that same vault beforehand and set
`DATABASE_URL_SECRET_NAME` and
`PILOTSWARM_CMS_FACTS_DATABASE_URL_SECRET_NAME` instead of raw URLs.
`seed-secrets` leaves reference-only secrets unchanged. Custom names can
also be supplied with raw URLs to choose the seed destination.
When both URLs use one secret name, their supplied values must agree.

For reference-only inputs, the manifests stage queries only secret
identifiers. When a raw URL is supplied, it compares that URL with the
selected Key Vault version in deployer memory and fails on any mismatch.
No returned secret value is logged or persisted. The stage pins the
versions and creates service-specific CSI projections with explicit
`secretKeyRef` entries. URL values never enter the staged BYO `.env`,
ConfigMaps, Bicep outputs cache, or uploaded manifest tree. Password auth
omits the AAD-user key rather than inventing a placeholder. Version changes
produce new Kubernetes Secret references, forcing fresh pods to wait for
the new CSI-synced Secret instead of starting with an old value.
An explicit `<URL_KEY>_SECRET_VERSION` can pin an existing 32-character
Key Vault version; otherwise `--steps manifests` resolves the latest.
Pinned reference-only inputs are checked with an ID-only lookup before
each manifest publication, including versions resolved earlier in the run.
A missing or inaccessible name/version fails before upload. Raw URLs must
match even an explicitly pinned version.

After changing a supplied URL, run `base-infra --steps seed-secrets`, then
publish the worker and portal manifests again. A raw URL in a manifests-only
invocation is **not** written to Key Vault; a changed value fails with an
instruction to run the seeding step first. Unchanged values work across
separate invocations without seeding again.
Infrastructure-only `--steps bicep`, build-only, and unrelated services do
not require database URLs. Only secret seeding and worker/portal manifest
staging require the BYO configuration.

### Bicep-side identity wiring

- **Storage** (`storage.bicep`) grants *Storage Blob Data Contributor*
  on the session blob container scope to the CSI UAMI principal.
- **Postgres** (`postgres.bicep`) enables AAD auth alongside password
  auth and assigns the CSI UAMI as primary AAD admin
  (`flexibleServers/administrators` resource keyed by principal object ID,
  display-name surfaced as the role name).

Both reuse the same CSI UAMI federated to the worker's KSA, so a single
identity covers KV → SPC, blob, and Postgres access.

### Postgres auth rationale

In MI mode all three Postgres consumers — CMS, facts, and the duroxide
orchestration store — authenticate to Azure Database for PostgreSQL
Flexible Server via Microsoft Entra ID:

- **CMS + facts** → AAD via `pg-pool-factory.ts` (`buildPgPoolConfig`),
  using `DefaultAzureCredential` and pg's `password` callback.
- **Duroxide store** → AAD via `duroxide-provider-factory.ts`
  (`createDuroxidePostgresProvider`), which calls duroxide-node's
  `PostgresProvider.connectWithSchemaAndEntra`. Duroxide resolves its
  credential chain in Rust (WorkloadIdentity → ManagedIdentity →
  DeveloperTools).

`DATABASE_URL` (password URL) is kept alongside for the legacy
`scripts/deploy-aks.sh` flow; in MI mode the duroxide store ignores any
embedded password. Fully passwordless deployments may flip
`passwordAuth: 'Disabled'` on the Bicep `postgres.bicep` module and
drop the bootstrap admin password from Key Vault and the
SecretProviderClass once their deploy path is on duroxide-node ≥ 0.1.25
(pilotswarm-sdk ≥ 0.1.30).

## Model provider types and runtime instances

The worker reads `model_providers.json` at startup as the provider TYPE/model
catalog. Runtime instances carry credentials and defaults in CMS. In the
bicep-deploy path the
canonical catalog lives at
[`deploy/gitops/worker/base/model_providers.json`](../gitops/worker/base/model_providers.json)
and is mounted into the pod via a kustomize-generated ConfigMap
(`copilot-worker-model-providers`) at `/app/config/model_providers.json`.
`PS_MODEL_PROVIDERS_PATH` is set on the deployment so the runtime picks
it up.

> **Legacy compatibility:** `scripts/deploy-aks.sh` still bakes
> `deploy/config/model_providers.ghcp.json` into the Docker image and
> reads it from `/app/.model_providers.json`. That catalog still carries env
> credential/default references so existing stamps bootstrap once. New stamp
> orchestration should provision provider instances and call
> `setModelDefault` / `setSystemModelDefault` after the management API is ready,
> then move to a type-only catalog.

### Built-in providers

The base catalog supplies three classes of providers:

| Provider | Auth | Source of secret/endpoint |
|---|---|---|
| `ghcp` (GitHub Copilot) | `GITHUB_TOKEN` (KV → SPC, optional, sentinel-tolerant; per-user PAT via Admin overrides) | Static endpoint `https://api.githubcopilot.com` |
| `anthropic` (direct) | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (KV → SPC, optional, sentinel-tolerant) | Static endpoint `https://api.anthropic.com` |
| `azure-foundry`, `azure-foundry-router` | `AZURE_OAI_KEY` (KV → SPC) | `__FOUNDRY_ENDPOINT__` placeholder, substituted at staging from the `FOUNDRY_ENDPOINT` Bicep output |

Foundry is **opt-in per stamp**. When `FOUNDRY_ENABLED=false`:
- `foundry.bicep` is skipped and no Foundry account is created.
- `auto-secrets-sentinel.bicep` writes the `__PS_UNSET__` sentinel into
  the `azure-oai-key` KV secret so the SPC mount still succeeds.
- The placeholder remains unresolved in the staged catalog; the worker's
  catalog loader silently drops the Foundry providers (their `apiKey:
  env:AZURE_OAI_KEY` resolves to the stripped sentinel → undefined).

### Enabling Foundry

1. `npm run deploy:new-env -- <name> --foundry-enabled y` — prompts you
   to populate `deploy/envs/local/<name>/foundry-deployments.json` with
   the deployment list. The scaffolder writes a starter array; the
   stdout banner lists common entries to copy in (gpt-5 family,
   gpt-4o, etc.). The file is parsed by `az` as a `--parameters
   foundryDeployments=@<file>` value, so it must be valid JSON.
2. Run `--steps bicep` for `base-infra`. `foundry.bicep` provisions one
   `Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts` (kind=AIServices) per stamp,
   declares each entry as a child `accounts/deployments` resource, and
   writes the account key to KV as `azure-oai-key` via co-located
   `listKeys()` (no separate auto-secrets module). The endpoint is
   surfaced to the env map as `FOUNDRY_ENDPOINT`.
3. Re-run `--steps manifests`. The placeholder
   `__FOUNDRY_ENDPOINT__/openai/v1` is rewritten to the real Foundry
   endpoint URL (trailing slash collapsed). Flux reconciles; the
   worker's catalog now has live Foundry providers.

### Per-stamp catalog overrides

To diverge from the base catalog for a single stamp, drop a kustomize
overlay patch on the `copilot-worker-model-providers` ConfigMap in
`deploy/gitops/worker/overlays/<overlay>/`. Keep the placeholder in the
patched JSON if you still want endpoint substitution; drop it if you
hard-code the URL.

> Phase 2 (SDK Entra-mode) and Phase 3 (Foundry-hosted Claude) are
> tracked in [`docs/proposals/foundry-entra-mode-auth.md`](../../docs/proposals/foundry-entra-mode-auth.md)
> and [`docs/proposals/foundry-hosted-claude.md`](../../docs/proposals/foundry-hosted-claude.md).
> Until those land, Foundry uses key auth and Claude is direct-Anthropic.
