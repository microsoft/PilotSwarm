// group-gated RBAC is in place before secrets flow. seed-secrets runs
// after bicep so the Key Vault exists and the deployer has the role assignment
// (granted by Bicep at create time), and before rollout so the worker pods
// can mount the populated secrets via CSI on first start. Real stage modules
