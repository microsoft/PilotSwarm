# Contributing to PilotSwarm

PilotSwarm is **experimental** and under active development. Contributions are
welcome, but please understand that the API surface, internal layout, and
release cadence are still in flux. Treat this as a research-grade project
rather than a stable platform.

## Before You Start

- Read the [README](README.md) and [Architecture](./docs/architecture/system.md) to
  understand the layering: client → orchestration → worker → managed session.
- For changes inside the durable session orchestration, read
  [Orchestration Design](./docs/architecture/orchestration/design.md). The orchestration is a
  duroxide replay generator — changing the order of yields is a versioning
  event, not a free refactor.
- Open an issue first for non-trivial work so we can discuss design before
  you spend time on a PR.

## Development Setup

Follow [Local tests and CI setup](docs/developer/contributing/local-ci-and-tests.md)
for Node.js 24+, credential-free PR checks, a disposable PostgreSQL container,
optional full/additive HorizonDB tests, and installing the GitHub workflows in
your own repository. It documents the actual full test wrapper and eight-file
parallelism. Never use an application database for test cleanup.

## Project Layout

```
packages/
  sdk/           — runtime, orchestration, worker, session manager, CMS catalog
    api/         —   zero-dep isomorphic Web API client (pilotswarm-sdk/api)
  app/           — the "pilotswarm" application package
    tui/         —   terminal UI host (+ pilotswarm/host node layer)
    web/         —   portal server (Web API host) + browser portal UI
    mcp/         —   MCP server (Web API mode)
    ui/          —   shared UI layers (pilotswarm/ui-core, pilotswarm/ui-react)
  horizon-store/ — optional enhanced facts/graph provider (dynamically imported)
docs/            — see docs/README.md (quickstart, user guide, architecture, API, developer)
deploy/          — Dockerfiles, Kubernetes manifests, runtime supervisor
```

Most contributions live under `packages/sdk/src/`.

## Pull Request Conventions

- **One change per PR.** Refactors, bug fixes, and features should be separate
  PRs even if related. It makes review possible.
- **Tests required for behavior changes.** New activities, orchestration
  branches, or tool implementations need at least one test under
  `packages/sdk/test/local/`. Pure refactors don't need new tests but must
  keep the existing suite green.
- **Keep `tsc --noEmit` clean.** Add types rather than `any` where practical.
- **Conventional-ish commit messages.** No strict tooling, but follow the
  style in `git log`: lowercase prefix (`sdk:`, `orch:`, `ui:`, `docs:`),
  concise subject, blank line, then a body that explains *why*.
- **Don't change the orchestration without a version bump.** If your change
  alters the order, count, or arguments of `yield` calls inside any
  `durableSessionOrchestration_*` handler, you must:
  1. Freeze the current latest as a `_X_Y_Z.ts` sibling
  2. Edit `packages/sdk/src/orchestration-version.ts` to bump the latest
  3. Update `packages/sdk/src/orchestration-registry.ts`
  4. Trim the registry to versions at or above the compatibility floor

  See [docs/architecture/orchestration/design.md §12](./docs/architecture/orchestration/design.md) for the
  full replay-safety rules.

## Continuous Integration

The full test suite is configured as a manual-trigger GitHub Action gated to
the maintainer. Forks won't auto-run it. When you open a PR, the maintainer
will run the suite once review converges.

You can run the full local suite at any time:

```bash
./scripts/run-tests.sh
```

It takes about 6 minutes against a healthy local Postgres + Copilot token.

## Coding Style

- TypeScript for new SDK code; JavaScript is fine for ui-core/ui-react/cli.
- 4-space indent, double-quoted strings.
- Avoid premature abstractions. Three similar lines beat a half-thought-out
  helper. The `simplify` skill in this repo lays out the philosophy.
- Avoid comments that describe *what* the code does. Comments are for *why* —
  hidden constraints, subtle invariants, surprising behavior.

## Filing Issues

Helpful issue reports include:

- the version of `pilotswarm-sdk` (or commit SHA if running from source)
- minimal reproduction steps
- the orchestration version (`packages/sdk/src/orchestration-version.ts`)
- relevant log output (worker traces, session events) — redact secrets first
