# Contributing to PilotSwarm

PilotSwarm is **experimental** and under active development. Contributions are
welcome, but please understand that the API surface, internal layout, and
release cadence are still in flux. Treat this as a research-grade project
rather than a stable platform.

## Before You Start

- Read the [README](README.md) and [Architecture](./docs/architecture/system.md) to
  understand the layering: client → orchestration → worker → managed session.
- For changes inside the durable session orchestration, read
  [Orchestration Design](./docs/architecture/orchestration/design.md). The orchestration is a
  duroxide replay generator — changing the order of yields is a versioning
  event, not a free refactor.
- Open an issue first for non-trivial work so we can discuss design before
  you spend time on a PR.

## Development Setup

1. **Prerequisites**

   - Node.js 20+
   - Docker (for local PostgreSQL) — or an existing Postgres instance reachable
     via a connection string
   - At least one LLM provider: a GitHub Copilot token (`GITHUB_TOKEN`) is the
     easiest, or any of the Azure / Anthropic providers configured in
     `.model_providers.json`

2. **Install and configure**

   ```bash
   npm install
   cp .env.example .env
   cp .model_providers.example.json .model_providers.json
   # edit .env: set DATABASE_URL and at least one provider key
   $EDITOR .model_providers.json
   ```

3. **Start Postgres** (skip if you already have one)

   ```bash
   docker run --rm -d \
     -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres \
     -e POSTGRES_DB=pilotswarm \
     -p 5432:5432 postgres:16
   ```

4. **Build and run the test suite**

   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm test
   npm run test:local           # full local integration suite (slow; needs LLM)
   ```

   For faster feedback while iterating on a specific area:

   ```bash
   npm run test:local:smoke
   npm run test:local:durability
   npm run test:local:sub-agents
   ```

   Plugin and consumer repositories can add an explicit Vitest directory to
   the complete PilotSwarm gate without changing its built-in suite:

   ```bash
   ./scripts/run-tests.sh --external-test-dir=../plugin-repo/tests/pilotswarm
   ```

   During plugin-only iteration, skip PilotSwarm's built-in phases and provider
   setup explicitly:

   ```bash
   ./scripts/run-tests.sh --external-only \
     --external-test-dir=../plugin-repo/tests/pilotswarm \
     --external-test-filter=audience-map
   ```

   External directories are optional and are never discovered automatically.
   Their tests should use public PilotSwarm package surfaces while keeping
   repository-specific fixtures, endpoints, and credentials in the repository
   that owns them.

   Each supplied directory is an independent Vitest root and must follow this
   contract:

   - Name test files `*.test.js`, `*.test.mjs`, `*.test.ts`, or `*.test.mts`.
   - Write tests for the Node environment. Vitest globals such as `describe`,
     `it`, and `expect` are enabled; tests do not need to import `vitest`.
   - Resolve fixtures relative to the test module, for example with
     `import.meta.url`. The supplied directory is Vitest's discovery root, but
     `process.cwd()` remains the PilotSwarm checkout that invokes the runner.
   - Install consumer dependencies and prepare generated artifacts before
     invoking the runner. `--external-only` does not build either repository.
     The consumer must install the public `pilotswarm-sdk` version it intends
     to validate; the runner does not substitute the platform checkout's
     private source tree for that package.
   - Provide required environment variables and credentials explicitly.
     PilotSwarm's `.env` and provider setup are not loaded by `--external-only`.
   - Import supported public package exports rather than private source files.
   - Keep shared setup inside the test directory or import it from the consumer
     package. The runner uses `scripts/external-vitest.config.mjs` and does not
     discover a consumer `vitest.config.*` automatically.
   - Treat `--external-test-filter` values as test-file path substrings, not
     individual test-name filters.

   A minimal external test can be created as
   `tests/pilotswarm/platform-contract.test.mjs`:

   ```js
   import { normalizeVisibility } from "pilotswarm-sdk/api";

   describe("platform integration", () => {
     it("uses a public platform contract", () => {
       expect(normalizeVisibility("SHARED_READ")).toBe("shared_read");
     });
   });
   ```

   Run it from the PilotSwarm checkout:

   ```bash
   ./scripts/run-tests.sh --external-only \
     --external-test-dir=../plugin-repo/tests/pilotswarm \
     --external-test-filter=platform-contract
   ```

## Project Layout

```
packages/
  sdk/           — runtime, orchestration, worker, session manager, CMS catalog
    api/         —   zero-dep isomorphic Web API client (pilotswarm-sdk/api)
  app/           — the "pilotswarm" application package
    tui/         —   terminal UI host (+ pilotswarm/host node layer)
    web/         —   portal server (Web API host) + browser portal UI
    mcp/         —   MCP server (Web API mode)
    ui/          —   shared UI layers (pilotswarm/ui-core, pilotswarm/ui-react)
  horizon-store/ — optional enhanced facts/graph provider (dynamically imported)
docs/            — see docs/README.md (quickstart, user guide, architecture, API, developer)
deploy/          — Dockerfiles, Kubernetes manifests, runtime supervisor
```

Most contributions live under `packages/sdk/src/`.

## Pull Request Conventions

- **One change per PR.** Refactors, bug fixes, and features should be separate
  PRs even if related. It makes review possible.
- **Tests required for behavior changes.** New activities, orchestration
  branches, or tool implementations need at least one test under
  `packages/sdk/test/local/`. Pure refactors don't need new tests but must
  keep the existing suite green.
- **Keep `tsc --noEmit` clean.** Add types rather than `any` where practical.
- **Conventional-ish commit messages.** No strict tooling, but follow the
  style in `git log`: lowercase prefix (`sdk:`, `orch:`, `ui:`, `docs:`),
  concise subject, blank line, then a body that explains *why*.
- **Don't change the orchestration without a version bump.** If your change
  alters the order, count, or arguments of `yield` calls inside any
  `durableSessionOrchestration_*` handler, you must:
  1. Freeze the current latest as a `_X_Y_Z.ts` sibling
  2. Edit `packages/sdk/src/orchestration-version.ts` to bump the latest
  3. Update `packages/sdk/src/orchestration-registry.ts`
  4. Trim the registry to versions at or above the compatibility floor

  See [docs/architecture/orchestration/design.md §12](./docs/architecture/orchestration/design.md) for the
  full replay-safety rules.

## Continuous Integration

The full test suite is configured as a manual-trigger GitHub Action gated to
the maintainer. Forks won't auto-run it. When you open a PR, the maintainer
will run the suite once review converges.

You can run the full local suite at any time:

```bash
./scripts/run-tests.sh
```

It takes about 6 minutes against a healthy local Postgres + Copilot token.

## Coding Style

- TypeScript for new SDK code; JavaScript is fine for ui-core/ui-react/cli.
- 4-space indent, double-quoted strings.
- Avoid premature abstractions. Three similar lines beat a half-thought-out
  helper. The `simplify` skill in this repo lays out the philosophy.
- Avoid comments that describe *what* the code does. Comments are for *why* —
  hidden constraints, subtle invariants, surprising behavior.

## Filing Issues

Helpful issue reports include:

- the version of `pilotswarm-sdk` (or commit SHA if running from source)
- minimal reproduction steps
- the orchestration version (`packages/sdk/src/orchestration-version.ts`)
- relevant log output (worker traces, session events) — redact secrets first
