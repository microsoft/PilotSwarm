# Agent Contracts

These are the behavior contracts that should stay aligned across prompts, tool descriptions, runtime validation, tests, and docs.

When any of these change, update all five layers together.

## 1. `default.agent.md` Is The Base Prompt

Contract:

- `default.agent.md` is not a selectable agent
- its markdown body becomes the always-on base system prompt for all sessions on the worker
- it still applies when a session or agent provides a prompt overlay

Why it matters:

- app-wide rules like `wait`, artifact handling, or sub-agent behavior belong here
- users should not have to rediscover those rules in each agent file

## 2. Named Agents And `agent_name`

Contract:

- if an agent is already known by name, spawn it with `spawn_agent(agent_name="...")`
- before generic or native delegation, inspect `ps_list_agents` when an adequate current catalog is not in context; it lists caller-visible static and enabled published agents
- prefer the specialist whose description, declared tools, skills and source access fit the job; pass the returned `agent_name` unchanged, including an explicit shared reference when needed
- `required_tool` is not a supported spawn argument; stale requests fail with discovery guidance rather than silently creating a generic child
- `task=` supplies the assignment for either named or custom children; a named agent uses its `initialPrompt` when no task is supplied
- the selected agent's own `initialRequiredTool` remains its startup requirement; the caller does not choose a startup tool
- a selected static namespace is preserved in its binding across workers and refresh, so same-name definitions cannot exchange prompts, tools or MCP grants
- named children always load their own declared tools (including an empty list) plus platform defaults; they do not inherit the parent's package tools or custom persona and cannot override the definition with `tool_names` or `system_message`
- each child's explicit `contract` crosses SDK creation and durable startup; a grandchild does not inherit its parent's own child contract
- parent links and nesting depth survive creation and first message on different API clients; invalid/cyclic ancestry fails before starting the child
- do not pass package-owned tools through `tool_names`; package prompt, skills, startup contract, and handlers stay attached to their owning named-agent definition
- known system agents like `sweeper` and `resourcemgr` should not be created via `task="..."`

Why it matters:

- named agents carry canonical metadata
- discovery and spawning use the same shared/private visibility and package-copy selection rules across workers
- system-agent titles and IDs depend on that named-agent path
- generic `task=` spawns can lose `agentId`, `title`, and expected behavior

## 3. Tools Live On The Worker

Contract:

- agent files and sessions reference tool names
- worker code registers the actual tool handlers
- clients never own the real tool handlers

Why it matters:

- this is the core client/worker serialization boundary
- remote mode only works if workers own the executable tool code

## 4. Agent `tools` Are Filters, Not Implementations

Contract:

- `tools` in `.agent.md` or inline agent config only limit what the agent may use
- they do not automatically create or register the tool

Why it matters:

- listing a tool name in a prompt file without registering it on the worker should not be treated as sufficient

## 5. Sub-Agent Model Selection Must Be Exact

Contract:

- `list_available_models` is the source of truth
- if a sub-agent should use a different model, the caller must use an exact returned `provider:model` value
- prompts and runtime validation should reject guessed or shortened names

Why it matters:

- available models can differ across environments and deployments
- prompt-only model recall is not reliable enough

## 6. Recurring Timers Have Two Shapes

Contract:

- use `cron(seconds=N, reason="...")` for fixed-interval recurring work
- use `cron_at(minute=M, hour=H, tz="Area/City", reason="...")` for wall-clock schedules
- do not implement wall-clock schedules by waking every N minutes to inspect the current time
- either `cron(action="cancel")` or `cron_at(action="cancel")` clears the active recurring schedule

Why it matters:

- calendar schedules should spend one LLM turn per intended fire, not one turn per no-op clock check
- timezone and DST semantics belong in runtime-owned scheduling, not prompt math

## 7. Child Wake Policy Is Contract Data

Contract:

- `contract` is a named argument on `spawn_agent`; there is no separate contract tool
- `spawn_agent(..., contract={ wakeOn: "any" | "material_change" | "completion" })` controls autonomous parent wake-ups
- contracts may also include compact `purpose`, `successCriteria`, `expectedFacts`, `expectedArtifacts`, and `validationMode` fields when required outputs matter
- missing or invalid `wakeOn` defaults to `material_change`
- finite delegated work whose result the parent needs uses `material_change`; an ordinary final reply leaves the child alive and idle
- `completion` is reserved for actual terminal lifecycle outcomes such as explicit completion, cancellation, failure, or a blocked verdict
- after validating a finite child's required outputs, the parent closes it explicitly with `complete_agent`
- `message_agent(..., contract_patch={ wakeOn: "..." })` can change the policy while a child is running
- explicit reads such as `check_agents` and `wait_for_agents` still show quiet heartbeat status
- qualifying updates wake the parent automatically; a parent must not schedule `wait` or `cron` solely to poll `check_agents`
- parent timers remain appropriate for independent deadlines, retries, or external checks that cannot notify the session

Why it matters:

- watcher children should not spend parent LLM turns for clear no-op heartbeats
- finite task results wake the parent without falsely treating the still-idle child as terminal
- material changes, terminal states, and unknown updates remain visible conservatively
- reactive wake-ups avoid no-op parent turns that only rediscover children are still running

## 8. Prompt-Only Rules Need Runtime Backstops

Contract:

- if a rule must always hold, do not rely only on prompt text
- add runtime validation or normalization for critical cases

Examples:

- normalize mistaken named-agent spawns where safe

## 9. Child Results Declare Output References

Contract:

- `complete_agent.result` and `cancel_agent.partial_result` use a structured result
- produced facts are declared as `factsWritten: [{ key: "..." }]`
- produced artifacts are declared as `artifactsWritten: [{ path: "..." }]`
- string arrays and compatibility aliases such as `outputs`, `factKeys`,
	`evidenceFactKeys`, `artifactPaths`, and `artifactPointers` are normalized by exact match
- a missing declaration is reported as `missing_fact_reference` or
	`missing_artifact_reference`; this does not claim the underlying store entry is absent

Why it matters:

- contract validation and store existence are separate questions
- explicit references let parents find outputs without copying child transcripts

## 10. Child Model Configuration Inherits As A Unit

Contract:

- without a spawn override, children inherit the parent's current durable model,
	reasoning effort, and context tier
- explicit `model` and `reasoning_effort` override only those requested fields
- the final child SDK creation call receives all three model configuration fields

Why it matters:

- model identity, reasoning effort, and context-window tier jointly define runtime behavior
- dropping the context tier can silently shrink a child session's available context

## 11. Long Waits May Migrate Unless Affinity Is Preserved

Contract:

- long durable waits may resume on a different worker
- if an agent is waiting on worker-local state, it must call `wait(..., preserveWorkerAffinity: true)`
- prompts, tool descriptions, and tests should all describe this consistently

Why it matters:

- node-local work is the main exception to the usual "durable waits can resume anywhere" model
- the LLM needs an explicit, reliable way to opt into preserving worker affinity
- reject invalid sub-agent model overrides
- preserve orchestration behavior even if prompt wording drifts

## 12. Artifact Rules Should Be Visible And Durable

Contract:

- if an agent creates a file users should retrieve, it should write the artifact and export it
- prompts can instruct this, but runtime and UI paths should also assume artifact links are part of the product surface

Why it matters:

- artifact links are how durable outputs move back to the user
- losing the export step produces confusing “the file exists somewhere” behavior

## 13. Session Summary State Is Structured (RETIRED)

Session summaries were removed in v0.5.36 — `update_session_summary` no
longer exists and no agent should be instructed to maintain summary state.
The session canvas (`draw_canvas`) superseded it as the standing at-a-glance
surface. Data-layer columns linger for a few releases; instructions must not.

## 14. Cross-Session Request/Response Uses Reply Tooling

Contract:

- `send_session_message(..., expects_response=true)` queues an asynchronous request into the target session
- the target session must call `reply_session_message(request_id=..., session_id=<sender>, body=...)` to return the answer
- answering only in the target session's own chat transcript does not deliver a response to the sender
- request and response protocol prompts are durable transcript items and should render as dedicated session request/reply cards in shared UI surfaces
- ordinary sessions may send requests or replies to system sessions; the same terminal-state, self-message, orchestration-live, and rate-limit guards still apply

Why it matters:

- cross-session coordination should be auditable and durable
- the sender needs a structured response event, not an answer stranded in another transcript

## 15. Change Procedure

If you change one of these contracts, update:

1. prompt or agent/skill file
2. tool descriptions or schemas
3. runtime behavior
4. tests
5. docs
