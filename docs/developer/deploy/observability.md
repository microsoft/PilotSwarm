# SigNoZ Observability And Metrics

This document describes the intended SigNoZ/OpenTelemetry architecture for
PilotSwarm, the telemetry signals implemented by the current observability PR,
what is still missing, and the next metrics to add.

Status: this is the current implementation note for the OpenTelemetry/SigNoZ
baseline. It documents the net result after the cleanup that removed the
`pilotswarm.stuck_activities` metric in favor of Duroxide-owned runtime
metrics.

## Goals

PilotSwarm needs two complementary observability surfaces:

1. Durable management data for product UI, agent-tuner investigations, and
   exact per-session reads.
2. Time-series telemetry for operational dashboards, alerting, and historical
   trend analysis.

The management path should keep using CMS-backed APIs such as
`PilotSwarmManagementClient`. The SigNoZ path should receive OpenTelemetry
traces and metrics from workers over OTLP.

## Intended Architecture

```text
PilotSwarm worker process
  |
  | Node preload: scripts/otel/register.mjs
  |
  | Custom spans:
  | - worker.bootstrap
  | - session.turn
  | - session.hydration
  | - session.dehydration
  |
  | Auto-instrumentation:
  | - Node runtime/library spans and metrics where enabled by OTel packages
  |
  v
OpenTelemetry SDK for Node.js
  |
  | OTLP HTTP trace export
  | OTLP HTTP metric export
  |
  v
SigNoZ OTLP ingest / OpenTelemetry Collector
  |
  v
SigNoZ storage and query layer
  |
  v
SigNoZ UI
  - Services: pilotswarm-worker
  - Traces: session.turn, session.hydration, session.dehydration
  - Metrics explorer: Node auto-instrumentation and future custom metrics
  - Dashboards and alerts: future work
```

The worker process should be the source of application-level telemetry because
it owns the Copilot SDK session, tool execution, hydration/dehydration, and the
duroxide runtime process.

## Implemented In The Current PR

### OTel Bootstrap

Implemented in `scripts/otel/register.mjs`.

| Capability | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Node OTel SDK startup | Implemented | Starts `NodeSDK` when required env vars are present. |
| OTLP trace exporter | Implemented | Sends to `${OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT}/v1/traces`. |
| OTLP metric exporter | Implemented | Sends to `${OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT}/v1/metrics`. |
| Node auto-instrumentation | Implemented | Uses `getNodeAutoInstrumentations()`. |
| Resource detection | Implemented | Uses `getResourceDetectors()`. |
| Bootstrap span | Implemented | Emits `worker.bootstrap` when SDK startup succeeds. |
| Optional debug logging | Implemented | `OTEL_LOG_LEVEL=debug`. |
| Graceful SDK shutdown | Implemented | Runs on `SIGTERM` and `beforeExit`. |

Current bootstrap env vars:

| Env var | Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` | Required | Base OTLP endpoint. |
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS` | Required today | Header string parsed as `key=value,key2=value2`. Needed for SigNoZ Cloud ingestion keys, but should become optional for self-hosted SigNoZ. |
| `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME` | Optional | Defaults to `pilotswarm-service`. Recommended value: `pilotswarm-worker`. |
| `OTEL_LOG_LEVEL` | Optional | Set to `debug` for OTel diagnostics. |
| `OTEL_METRIC_EXPORT_INTERVAL` | Optional | Metric export interval in ms. Defaults to `30000`. |

The root `npm run worker` script preloads the bootstrap:

```bash
node --env-file=.env.remote --import ./scripts/otel/register.mjs packages/sdk/examples/worker.js
```

## Required Metric Dimensions

Future PilotSwarm-owned metrics should use a consistent dimension set so
SigNoZ dashboards can slice the fleet the same way across turns, tools, facts,
skills, and cross-session messages.

| Dimension | Required? | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `agent_id` | Yes when available | Stable named-agent id or system-agent id. Prefer this for joins and alert routing. |
| `agent_name` | Yes when available | Human-readable agent name/type shown in dashboards. Keep bounded to named agent definitions and known system agents. |
| `user` | Yes when available | Normalized user/owner dimension for per-user fleet health and cost. Avoid raw email addresses in long-retention telemetry when a stable non-PII identifier is available. |
| `is_system` | Yes | Boolean string or boolean label indicating whether the session/agent is a system session. |
| `model` | Yes for LLM-turn metrics | Model used by the turn. |
| `worker_node_id` | Yes for worker-local metrics | Worker/pod/node that emitted the signal. |
| `result` | Yes for request/lifecycle counters | Low-cardinality status such as `completed`, `error`, `lossy_handoff`, `timeout`, or `cancelled`. |

Avoid `session_id` on long-retained metric series by default. Keep
`session_id` on traces and CMS/management reads where high-cardinality lookup is
expected. If a short-retention debug metric needs `session_id`, it should be
explicitly marked as operator/debug only.

### Custom Trace Spans

Implemented in `packages/sdk/src/session-proxy.ts` and
`scripts/otel/register.mjs`.

| Span | Tracer | Scenario |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `worker.bootstrap` | `pilotswarm-bootstrap` | Confirms the OTel bootstrap ran successfully. |
| `session.turn` | `pilotswarm-turns` | One worker turn, including model, token, tool, result, and worker attributes. |
| `session.dehydration` | `pilotswarm-lifecycle` | One dehydrate activity, including reason, result, snapshot size, and lossy handoff status. |
| `session.hydration` | `pilotswarm-lifecycle` | One hydrate activity, including success/error result. |

### Custom Metrics

No custom OTel metric instruments remain in the net PR after the cleanup commit.

The original #29 branch added `pilotswarm.stuck_activities`, but that metric was
removed because it queried the Postgres implementation tables inside duroxide
directly. Duroxide is provider-based, so PilotSwarm should not depend on the
`duroxide.worker_queue` table shape. Queue-depth telemetry should come from
duroxide's own metrics surface or management API.

The PR still creates an OTLP metric exporter and enables Node auto-instrumented
metrics. Those metric names and label sets are owned by the OpenTelemetry
instrumentation packages, not by PilotSwarm.

## Implemented Signal Spec

### `worker.bootstrap`

Emitted once when `scripts/otel/register.mjs` successfully starts the OTel SDK.

| Attribute | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `service.name` | string | Configured service name. |
| `telemetry.bootstrap` | boolean | Always `true`; marks successful bootstrap. |

Scenarios covered:

- Verify the worker process actually loaded the OTel bootstrap.
- Confirm SigNoZ ingestion works before waiting for a real session turn.
- Check service naming and resource attribution in SigNoZ.

Limitations:

- It is not a worker startup duration span. It is a marker span.
- It is only emitted if the bootstrap has endpoint/header env vars and starts.

### `session.turn`

Emitted around `runTurn` execution in the worker activity.

Initial attributes:

| Attribute | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `pilotswarm.session_id` | string | Session id. High cardinality; useful for trace investigation, not long-retention metrics labels. |
| `pilotswarm.turn_index` | number | Turn index, default `0`. |
| `pilotswarm.bootstrap` | boolean | Whether this is a bootstrap turn. |
| `pilotswarm.retry_count` | number | Retry count for the turn, default `0`. |
| `pilotswarm.nesting_level` | number | Sub-agent nesting level, default `0`. |
| `pilotswarm.has_parent_session` | boolean | Whether the session has a parent. |
| `pilotswarm.parent_session_id` | string | Parent session id, when present. |
| `pilotswarm.required_tool` | string | Required tool name, when present. |
| `pilotswarm.model` | string | Configured model, when present. |
| `pilotswarm.reasoning_effort` | string | Configured reasoning effort, when present. |
| `pilotswarm.worker_node_id` | string | Worker node id, when present. |

Final attributes:

| Attribute | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `pilotswarm.model_summary` | string | Model provider summary from the session manager. |
| `pilotswarm.tokens_input` | number | Input token delta observed during this turn. |
| `pilotswarm.tokens_output` | number | Output token delta observed during this turn. |
| `pilotswarm.tokens_cache_read` | number | Cache-read token delta observed during this turn. |
| `pilotswarm.tokens_cache_write` | number | Cache-write token delta observed during this turn. |
| `pilotswarm.tool_calls` | number | Count of `tool.execution_start` events during the turn. |
| `pilotswarm.tool_errors` | number | Count of failed `tool.execution_complete` events during the turn. |
| `pilotswarm.tool_names` | string | Comma-joined sorted tool names observed during the turn. |
| `pilotswarm.turn_result` | string | Final `TurnResult.type`, when a result exists. |

Error behavior:

- Exceptions are recorded on the span with `recordException` and status `ERROR`.
- A final `TurnResult` of type `error` also marks the span `ERROR`.

Scenarios covered:

- Turn latency by model, worker, parent/child status, and nesting level.
- Turn error rate by model, worker, and required tool.
- Per-turn token usage and cache behavior.
- Per-turn tool call and tool error visibility.
- Sub-agent turn behavior through nesting and parent attributes.
- Routing diagnostics by `pilotswarm.worker_node_id`.

Limitations:

- Token fields are per-turn deltas even though the names do not include
  `_delta`. Dashboards should treat them as turn-local values.
- `pilotswarm.tool_names` is a comma-separated string. A future change should
  use a string-array attribute if supported cleanly by the backend.
- This is a trace span, not a metrics histogram. Latency is queryable from span
  duration, but no custom histogram is exported yet.

### `session.dehydration`

Emitted around the dehydrate activity.

Initial attributes:

| Attribute | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `pilotswarm.session_id` | string | Session id. |
| `pilotswarm.dehydration_reason` | string | Dehydrate reason, default `unknown`. |
| `pilotswarm.worker_node_id` | string | Worker node id. |

Result attributes:

| Attribute | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `pilotswarm.dehydration_result` | string | `completed`, `lossy_handoff`, or `error`. |
| `pilotswarm.lossy_handoff` | boolean | `true` when the worker lost local session state before dehydrate completed. |
| `pilotswarm.snapshot_size_bytes` | number | Snapshot size after successful dehydrate, when available. |

Error behavior:

- Missing local session state marks the span as `ERROR` with result
  `lossy_handoff` and records the existing lossy handoff CMS event.
- Other failures record the exception, set result `error`, and mark the span
  `ERROR`.

Scenarios covered:

- Dehydrate latency and error rate.
- Lossy handoff detection.
- Snapshot size distribution.
- Dehydrate reason analysis.
- Worker-local lifecycle diagnostics.

Limitations:

- Snapshot size is read from the session store only on successful dehydrate and
  only when available.
- Counters are still maintained through CMS summaries, not custom OTel counters.

### `session.hydration`

Emitted around the hydrate activity.

Initial attributes:

| Attribute | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `pilotswarm.session_id` | string | Session id. |
| `pilotswarm.worker_node_id` | string | Worker node id. |

Result attributes:

| Attribute | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `pilotswarm.hydration_result` | string | `completed` or `error`. |

Error behavior:

- Hydrate failures record the exception and mark the span `ERROR`.

Scenarios covered:

- Hydrate latency and error rate.
- Worker handoff diagnostics.
- Session recovery path visibility.

Limitations:

- Hydration counters are still maintained through CMS summaries, not custom
  OTel counters.

## Implemented Versus Missing

| Area | Implemented | Missing |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Local OTel bootstrap | Root `npm run worker` preloads `scripts/otel/register.mjs`. | Deployment worker image and start scripts do not preload it yet. |
| Trace export | OTLP HTTP trace exporter. | Env plumbing in deploy manifests/secrets. |
| Metric export | OTLP HTTP metric exporter and Node auto-instrumentation. | PilotSwarm-owned custom metric instruments. |
| Turn telemetry | `session.turn` spans with model, token, tool, worker, result attributes. | Turn latency histogram, token counters, tool counters, and normalized `agent_name`/`user`/`is_system` dimensions. |
| Lifecycle telemetry | `session.hydration` and `session.dehydration` spans. | Lifecycle counters/histograms. |
| Fact-store telemetry | None in this PR. | Fact reads/writes, key structure, result, latency, and bytes. |
| Skill telemetry | CMS-backed skill usage exists elsewhere, but no OTel metric in this PR. | Skill invocation metrics with learned/static classification. |
| Agent messaging telemetry | Session request/reply cards exist as product events, but no OTel metric in this PR. | Parent/child and session-to-session message counters and latency. |
| Duroxide runtime/provider metrics | Not bridged in this PR. | All Duroxide metrics should be made available through PilotSwarm's OTel export path without reading provider tables directly. |
| Queue health | Removed from this PR. | Bridge Duroxide queue-depth metrics or expose via provider-safe management API. |
| SigNoZ dashboards | None. | Dashboard definitions, alert definitions, query recipes. |
| Operator docs | This document. | Environment-specific deployment guide and screenshots. |
| Agent tuner access | CMS summaries still exist for some data. | New OTel-derived or queue-health signals exposed through `PilotSwarmManagementClient` and tuner inspect tools. |

## Current Deployment Gap

The current deployment path does not yet load the OTel bootstrap:

- `deploy/Dockerfile.worker` starts `node packages/sdk/examples/worker.js`.
- `deploy/bin/start-worker.sh` starts `node packages/sdk/examples/worker.js`.
- The worker image does not copy `scripts/otel/register.mjs` today.
- Kubernetes and Bicep config do not wire `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`,
  `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS`, or `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME`.

Until those are wired, this PR can be tested with the root `npm run worker`
path, but production worker pods will not emit the new custom spans.

## Recommended SigNoZ Views

Once deployed, use these starting points in SigNoZ:

| Question | View / Query Starting Point |
| --- | --- |
| Is the worker exporting telemetry? | Search traces for `worker.bootstrap`; service should appear as `pilotswarm-worker` if `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME` is set. |
| How long do turns take? | Trace explorer, span name `session.turn`, group by `pilotswarm.model`, agent, user, `is_system`, and `pilotswarm.worker_node_id`. |
| Which turns fail? | Span status `ERROR`, span name `session.turn`, filter by `pilotswarm.turn_result`. |
| Are tools failing? | Span name `session.turn`, filter `pilotswarm.tool_errors > 0`, inspect `pilotswarm.tool_names`. |
| Are hydrations failing? | Span name `session.hydration`, status `ERROR` or `pilotswarm.hydration_result = error`. |
| Are dehydrations lossy? | Span name `session.dehydration`, `pilotswarm.dehydration_result = lossy_handoff`. |
| Are snapshots growing? | Span name `session.dehydration`, chart `pilotswarm.snapshot_size_bytes`. |
| Which users or agent types are driving load? | Turn/token/tool dashboards grouped by `user`, `agent_name`, `agent_id`, and `is_system`. |
| Are fact-store or skill workflows noisy? | Future fact/skill metrics grouped by key structure, skill type, agent, user, and result. |
| Are agents messaging each other successfully? | Future message metrics grouped by source/target agent, relationship, message type, and result. |

## Next Steps To Complete The Rollout

1. Copy `scripts/otel/register.mjs` into the worker image.
2. Preload the bootstrap in the real worker deployment path:

   ```bash
   node --import ./scripts/otel/register.mjs packages/sdk/examples/worker.js
   ```

3. Add deployment configuration for:

   ```text
   OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=https://<signoz-otlp-endpoint>
   OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS=signoz-ingestion-key=<key>
   OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=pilotswarm-worker
   OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES=deployment.environment=<env>,service.namespace=pilotswarm
   ```

4. Make `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS` optional so self-hosted SigNoZ can run
   without fake headers.
5. Move OTel dependencies into `packages/sdk/package.json` if the SDK package
   imports `@opentelemetry/api` in published code.
6. Bridge all Duroxide runtime/provider metrics into the same PilotSwarm OTel
  pipeline.
7. Add dashboard definitions or documented SigNoZ query recipes.
8. Add alerts for turn failures, lossy handoffs, lifecycle failures, and queue
   backlog.
9. Expose operator-grade signals through `PilotSwarmManagementClient` and tuner
   inspect tools when the signal is useful for autonomous investigations.

## Metrics To Add Next

### Duroxide Runtime And Provider Metrics

All Duroxide metrics should be made available through PilotSwarm's
OpenTelemetry export path. PilotSwarm is the product-level runtime wrapper, so
operators should not need a separate Duroxide metrics pipeline to see queue,
runtime, provider, activity, timer, replay, lock, or storage health in SigNoZ.

This must preserve Duroxide's provider abstraction:

- Prefer bridging Duroxide's own metrics surface into OTel.
- Prefer Duroxide client/management APIs for pull-based observable gauges.
- Do not query Duroxide provider tables directly from PilotSwarm.
- If a desired metric only exists inside one provider's tables, add it to
  Duroxide's provider/management surface first so every provider can implement
  it.

The first required Duroxide metrics are queue-depth signals, but the contract is
broader: every Duroxide metric that exists or is added later should be exported
through the PilotSwarm OTel/SigNoZ path.

#### Duroxide Queue Metrics

Duroxide already exposes queue depths as provider-safe signals:

- `duroxide_worker_queue_depth`
- `duroxide_orchestrator_queue_depth`
- `Client::get_queue_depths()` / Node `client.getQueueDepths()`

Next step: bridge those into the OTel pipeline without reading provider tables
directly from PilotSwarm.

Candidate metrics:

| Metric | Type | Labels | Scenario |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `duroxide_worker_queue_depth` | gauge | `worker_node_id`, `deployment.environment` | Worker backlog and capacity planning. |
| `duroxide_orchestrator_queue_depth` | gauge | `deployment.environment` | Orchestrator backlog. |
| `duroxide_timer_queue_depth` | gauge | `deployment.environment` | Timer backlog and wake-up pressure. |
| `pilotswarm_worker_queue_stale_depth` | gauge | threshold, deployment labels | Count visible queue work older than a provider-defined threshold. This should be added to duroxide's management/provider layer first. |

Other Duroxide metric families to bridge as they become available:

| Metric family | Examples | Scenario |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Activity execution | scheduled, started, completed, failed, retried | Activity throughput and retry storms. |
| Orchestration replay | replay count, replay duration, nondeterminism failures | Replay pressure and determinism incidents. |
| Durable timers | timers scheduled, fired, overdue, cancelled | Timer backlog and wake-up drift. |
| Provider locks | lock acquisition latency, lock timeouts, abandoned locks | Provider contention and stuck workers. |
| Provider storage | operation duration, operation errors, bytes read/written | Duroxide backend health independent of PilotSwarm CMS/facts. |

### Turn Metrics

The current PR has turn data on spans. Add metrics when dashboards need cheap
time-window aggregation without scanning traces.

| Metric | Type | Labels | Scenario |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `pilotswarm_turn_duration_ms` | histogram | `model`, `agent_id`, `agent_name`, `user`, `is_system`, `result`, `required_tool` | Latency SLOs and regression detection. |
| `pilotswarm_turns_total` | counter | `model`, `agent_id`, `agent_name`, `user`, `is_system`, `result` | Turn throughput and failure rate. |
| `pilotswarm_turn_tokens_input_total` | counter | `model`, `agent_id`, `agent_name`, `user`, `is_system` | Token spend trends. |
| `pilotswarm_turn_tokens_output_total` | counter | `model`, `agent_id`, `agent_name`, `user`, `is_system` | Token spend trends. |
| `pilotswarm_turn_tokens_cache_read_total` | counter | `model`, `agent_id`, `agent_name`, `user`, `is_system` | Cache effectiveness. |
| `pilotswarm_turn_tokens_cache_write_total` | counter | `model`, `agent_id`, `agent_name`, `user`, `is_system` | Cache write cost. |

Avoid `session_id` labels on long-retention metrics by default. Keep
`session_id` on spans and CMS management reads where high-cardinality lookup is
expected.

### Tool Metrics

| Metric | Type | Labels | Scenario |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `pilotswarm_tool_calls_total` | counter | `tool_name`, `agent_id`, `agent_name`, `user`, `is_system`, `model`, `result` | Tool usage patterns. |
| `pilotswarm_tool_errors_total` | counter | `tool_name`, `agent_id`, `agent_name`, `user`, `is_system`, `model`, `error_type` | Tool failure alerts. |
| `pilotswarm_tool_duration_ms` | histogram | `tool_name`, `agent_id`, `agent_name`, `user`, `is_system`, `result` | Slow tool investigation. |

### Lifecycle Metrics

| Metric | Type | Labels | Scenario |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `pilotswarm_hydrations_total` | counter | `agent_id`, `agent_name`, `user`, `is_system`, `result`, `worker_node_id` | Hydration reliability. |
| `pilotswarm_dehydrations_total` | counter | `agent_id`, `agent_name`, `user`, `is_system`, `reason`, `result`, `worker_node_id` | Dehydrate reliability. |
| `pilotswarm_lossy_handoffs_total` | counter | `agent_id`, `agent_name`, `user`, `is_system`, `reason`, `worker_node_id` | Alert on data-loss risk. |
| `pilotswarm_snapshot_size_bytes` | histogram | `agent_id`, `agent_name`, `user`, `is_system`, `model` | Snapshot growth and storage pressure. |
| `pilotswarm_hydration_duration_ms` | histogram | `agent_id`, `agent_name`, `user`, `is_system`, `result` | Recovery latency. |
| `pilotswarm_dehydration_duration_ms` | histogram | `agent_id`, `agent_name`, `user`, `is_system`, `reason`, `result` | Shutdown/handoff latency. |

### Fact Store Metrics

Fact-store metrics should expose durable-memory pressure and read/write
patterns without putting raw fact keys or fact values into long-retention metric
labels. Use bounded key-shape dimensions, not arbitrary key text.

Recommended key-structure labels:

- `fact_namespace`: high-level domain or table, such as `skills`, `memory`, or
  app-specific bounded categories.
- `fact_key_kind`: normalized key shape, not the raw key. Examples:
  `skill`, `session`, `agent`, `global`, `user`, `unknown`.
- `fact_scope`: bounded scope such as `session`, `agent`, `user`, or `fleet`.
- `result`: `hit`, `miss`, `written`, `error`, `conflict`, or similar bounded
  values.

Candidate metrics:

| Metric | Type | Labels | Scenario |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `pilotswarm_fact_reads_total` | counter | `agent_id`, `agent_name`, `user`, `is_system`, `fact_namespace`, `fact_key_kind`, `fact_scope`, `result` | Fact-store read volume, misses, and errors. |
| `pilotswarm_fact_writes_total` | counter | `agent_id`, `agent_name`, `user`, `is_system`, `fact_namespace`, `fact_key_kind`, `fact_scope`, `result` | Fact-store write volume and write failures. |
| `pilotswarm_fact_read_duration_ms` | histogram | `agent_id`, `agent_name`, `user`, `is_system`, `fact_namespace`, `fact_key_kind`, `result` | Slow fact reads. |
| `pilotswarm_fact_write_duration_ms` | histogram | `agent_id`, `agent_name`, `user`, `is_system`, `fact_namespace`, `fact_key_kind`, `result` | Slow fact writes. |
| `pilotswarm_fact_payload_bytes` | histogram | `agent_id`, `agent_name`, `user`, `is_system`, `fact_namespace`, `fact_key_kind`, `operation` | Payload growth and storage pressure. |

Scenarios covered:

- Detect fact-store hot spots by agent, user, and key structure.
- Detect static or learned skill lookup misses.
- Track memory/fact write amplification by agent type.
- Identify slow or failing fact-store operations without exposing raw keys.

### Skill Metrics

Skill metrics should separate static skills bundled with the agent/runtime from
learned skills pulled from the fact/knowledge layer.

Candidate labels:

- `skill_key`: bounded curated skill identifier. Avoid freeform skill titles if
  they can grow without limit.
- `skill_source`: `static` or `learned`.
- `skill_topic`: optional bounded topic/category.
- `result`: `selected`, `read`, `invoked`, `error`, `miss`, or `unused`.

Candidate metrics:

| Metric | Type | Labels | Scenario |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `pilotswarm_skill_invocations_total` | counter | `agent_id`, `agent_name`, `user`, `is_system`, `skill_key`, `skill_source`, `skill_topic`, `result` | Static vs learned skill usage and failures. |
| `pilotswarm_skill_reads_total` | counter | `agent_id`, `agent_name`, `user`, `is_system`, `skill_key`, `skill_source`, `skill_topic`, `result` | Skill retrieval volume and misses. |
| `pilotswarm_skill_invocation_duration_ms` | histogram | `agent_id`, `agent_name`, `user`, `is_system`, `skill_source`, `skill_topic`, `result` | Slow skill execution or retrieval path. |
| `pilotswarm_skill_context_bytes` | histogram | `agent_id`, `agent_name`, `user`, `is_system`, `skill_source`, `skill_topic` | Prompt/context pressure from skills. |

Scenarios covered:

- Compare learned vs static skill adoption.
- Alert on skill lookup failures.
- Find skills that dominate prompt context.
- Identify agents/users depending on learned skills.

### Agent Messaging Metrics

Agent-to-agent and session-to-session messaging should cover both structured
parent/child flows and general session messages.

Candidate labels:

- `message_kind`: `parent_child`, `session_to_session`, `broadcast`, or
  `unknown`.
- `relationship`: `parent_to_child`, `child_to_parent`, `peer`, or `system`.
- `source_agent_id`, `source_agent_name`, `source_is_system`.
- `target_agent_id`, `target_agent_name`, `target_is_system`.
- `user`: owner/user associated with the source session.
- `result`: `sent`, `delivered`, `responded`, `timeout`, `error`, `cancelled`.

Candidate metrics:

| Metric | Type | Labels | Scenario |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `pilotswarm_agent_messages_total` | counter | `message_kind`, `relationship`, `source_agent_id`, `source_agent_name`, `source_is_system`, `target_agent_id`, `target_agent_name`, `target_is_system`, `user`, `result` | Message volume and failures across parent/child and session-to-session flows. |
| `pilotswarm_agent_message_latency_ms` | histogram | `message_kind`, `relationship`, `source_agent_name`, `target_agent_name`, `user`, `result` | Request/reply latency between agents or sessions. |
| `pilotswarm_agent_message_payload_bytes` | histogram | `message_kind`, `relationship`, `source_agent_name`, `target_agent_name` | Large message detection and context pressure. |
| `pilotswarm_agent_message_timeouts_total` | counter | `message_kind`, `relationship`, `source_agent_name`, `target_agent_name`, `user` | Alertable stalled conversations. |

Scenarios covered:

- Detect parent/child agent coordination failures.
- Detect slow session-to-session request/reply flows.
- Identify high-volume agent pairs.
- Alert on message timeouts or failed delivery.

Privacy and cardinality note: do not put message text or unbounded session
titles into metric labels. Use trace attributes or durable event records for
message-level investigation.

### Worker And Runtime Metrics

| Metric | Type | Labels | Scenario |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `pilotswarm_worker_bootstrap_total` | counter | `worker_node_id`, `version` | Worker restart spikes. |
| `pilotswarm_worker_active_sessions` | gauge | `worker_node_id`, `is_system` | Load distribution. |
| `pilotswarm_worker_run_turn_lock_wait_ms` | histogram | `worker_node_id`, `agent_id`, `agent_name`, `user`, `is_system` | Lock contention. |
| `pilotswarm_worker_dehydrate_inflight` | gauge | `worker_node_id`, `is_system` | Shutdown pressure. |

### Management And Agent-Tuner Surfaces

Some signals should not live only in SigNoZ. If a signal is needed for incident
investigations by the agent tuner, expose it through:

1. Durable storage or bounded provider-safe read API.
2. `PilotSwarmManagementClient`.
3. A tuner inspect tool.

Good candidates:

- Queue depth and stale queue work.
