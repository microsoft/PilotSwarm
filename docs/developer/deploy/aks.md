# Deploying to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

This guide walks through deploying PilotSwarm workers to AKS for production multi-node operation.

> **Two deployment paths.** The repo ships two side-by-side ways to deploy
> PilotSwarm to AKS:
>
> 1. **Legacy `scripts/deploy-aks.sh`** (the rest of this document).
>    Imperative bash + raw `kubectl apply` against `deploy/k8s/*.yaml`.
>    Stable, well-trodden, and not going away.
> 2. **GitOps IaC pipeline under `deploy/`** (described below in
>    [GitOps IaC Path](#gitops-iac-path)). Bicep-managed Azure infra +
>    Flux-driven cluster manifests, pulled from versioned blob
>    containers. Modeled on a known-good internal reference
>    implementation, simplified for PilotSwarm's single-service Node.js
>    shape. This path adds Edge Mode (AFD vs Private AppGw) and TLS
>    Source (AKV vs Let's Encrypt) topology choices.
>
> Choose one. They share the same Kubernetes cluster shape but stamp it
> out via different mechanisms; running both against the same cluster
> will fight over the same resources.

## GitOps IaC Path

The IaC pipeline under `deploy/` provisions Azure infra via Bicep and
keeps cluster state in sync via Flux Kustomizations sourced from blob
containers. Public entry points:

- `deploy/scripts/new-env.mjs` — generate a per-env `.env` + bicep
  parameter files. Picks defaults for the topology axes below.
- `deploy/scripts/deploy.mjs` — orchestrates the per-service bicep +
  manifest stage in `infraOrder` then `services` order from
  `deploy/services/deploy-manifest.json`.
- `deploy/scripts/test/*.test.mjs` — `npm run test:deploy-scripts`.

### Topology Matrix

The IaC path supports an `(EDGE_MODE × TLS_SOURCE)` matrix plus the
optional `VPN_GATEWAY_ENABLED` axis. Five combinations are supported;
the rest are blocked at preflight (see [Unsupported Combinations](#unsupported-combinations)
and the named diagnostic codes in [Optional: VPN Gateway P2S](#optional-vpn-gateway-p2s-hybrid-afd--vpn)):

| `EDGE_MODE` | `TLS_SOURCE`     | Edge ingress                                  | Cert source                                            | Notes                                          |
|-------------|------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `afd`       | `letsencrypt`    | AFD → AppGw (Private Link) + AGIC             | cert-manager + Let's Encrypt prod (HTTP-01)            | OSS default. Zero CA setup.                    |
| `afd`       | `akv`            | AFD → AppGw (Private Link) + AGIC             | OneCertV2-PublicCA via AKV (registered automatically)  | enterprise default. BYO public CA.                    |
| `afd` + VPN | `akv`            | AFD → AppGw (Private Link) **and** Azure VPN Gateway P2S → same AppGw private FE | OneCertV2-PublicCA via AKV (shared with AFD path) | Hybrid trusted-bypass; opt-in via `VPN_GATEWAY_ENABLED=true`. AKV-only. See [Optional: VPN Gateway P2S](#optional-vpn-gateway-p2s-hybrid-afd--vpn). |
| `private`   | `akv`            | AKS web-app-routing addon (NGINX) + ILB       | OneCertV2-PrivateCA via AKV (registered automatically) | Enterprise / AME. No AFD, no AppGw, no AGIC.   |
| `private`   | `akv-selfsigned` | AKS web-app-routing addon (NGINX) + ILB       | AKV `Self` issuer (auto-generated, in-place)           | No CA; private-VNet smoke tests.               |

Default for OSS = `afd` + `letsencrypt`. Default for the enterprise path =
`afd` + `akv`.

- **`EDGE_MODE=afd`** — Azure Front Door fronts a regional Application
  Gateway over Private Link. Public TLS terminates at AFD; AppGw is
  reachable only via the AFD private endpoint. Use for any Internet-
  facing deployment.
- **`EDGE_MODE=private`** — No AFD, no AppGw, no AGIC, no GlobalInfra
  resource group. AKS uses the [web-app-routing
  addon](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/aks/app-routing) (managed
  NGINX) with an internal-only Azure Load Balancer. Reachable from
  peered VNets / Bastion / VPN / ExpressRoute. The `globalinfra` and
  `afd` services are skipped by `deploy.mjs`. Bicep also provisions a
  Private DNS Zone (`PRIVATE_DNS_ZONE`) and links it to the AKS VNet;
  `deploy.mjs` writes an A record `${HOST}.${PRIVATE_DNS_ZONE}` →
  internal LB IP after the Portal rolls out.
- **`TLS_SOURCE=akv`** — Portal cert is issued by an AKV cert issuer.
  The bicep auto-registers `OneCertV2-PublicCA` (afd mode) or
  `OneCertV2-PrivateCA` (private mode) on the Key Vault using the
  shared `akv-certificate-issuer.bicep` module — no manual issuer
  setup. Override with `PORTAL_TLS_ISSUER_NAME` if you have a different
  registered CA. Cert is projected into the cluster via Secret Store
  CSI; afd mode binds it to AppGw via the `appgw-ssl-certificate` AGIC
  annotation, private mode mounts it directly into the NGINX-fronted
  Portal pod's TLS secret.
- **`TLS_SOURCE=akv-selfsigned`** *(private only)* — uses the AKV
  built-in `Self` issuer to mint a self-signed cert. Browsers will
  warn; only suitable for private-VNet smoke tests where you control
  the trust store.
- **`TLS_SOURCE=letsencrypt`** *(afd only)* — `cert-manager` is
  installed in-cluster via Flux (HelmRelease pinned to v1.20.2 exact).
  The `letsencrypt-prod` ClusterIssuer (HTTP-01 solver) issues a real
  CA cert and writes it into the K8s Secret named in the Ingress
  `tls.secretName`. AGIC imports it from there. No AKV cert, no
  manual upload step. Requires `ACME_EMAIL` in the env.

### Variant Overlays

`deploy/gitops/portal/overlays/` ships three flavors, one per supported
combo (`akv` and `akv-selfsigned` share an overlay because the only
difference is the AKV issuer name, set by Portal bicep, not by
kustomize):

- `afd-letsencrypt/` — AFD + AppGw + AGIC + cert-manager-managed Secret.
- `afd-akv/` — AFD + AppGw + AGIC + Secret Store CSI (AKV cert).
- `private-akv/` — web-app-routing NGINX + ILB + Secret Store CSI
  (AKV cert, OneCertV2-PrivateCA or `Self`).

Portal bicep selects the overlay automatically:

```bicep
kustomizationPath: 'overlays/${edgeMode}-${
  tlsSource == 'akv-selfsigned' ? 'akv' : tlsSource
}'
```

### Skip Logic

`deploy.mjs` skips entire services based on env flags:

| Service                  | Skip when                                            |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `globalinfra`, `afd`     | `EDGE_MODE != afd`                                   |
| `cert-manager`           | `TLS_SOURCE != letsencrypt`                          |
| `cert-manager-issuers`   | `TLS_SOURCE != letsencrypt`                          |

Both single-service runs (`deploy.mjs <svc>`) and `deploy.mjs all` honor
these gates.

### cert-manager Pinning

`deploy/gitops/cert-manager/base/helm-release.yaml` pins
`version: 1.20.2` exact (no semver range). To upgrade, edit that field
in a PR — Flux will not auto-roll. The OCI HelmRepository points at
`oci://quay.io/jetstack/charts` (official Jetstack registry) for OSS;
the enterprise path stays on the AKV path so this chart source is OSS-only.

ClusterIssuers live in a separate Kustomization
(`cert-manager-issuers`) so the issuer install retries cleanly while
cert-manager CRDs are landing — Flux retry handles the ordering, no
explicit `dependsOn` between the two fluxConfigurations resources.

### Private Mode: NGINX + Internal LB + Private DNS

In `EDGE_MODE=private` the cluster uses the AKS web-app-routing addon
(`addonProfiles.webAppRouting`) instead of AGIC. The addon installs a
managed NGINX ingress controller in the `app-routing-system`
namespace; the default ingress class is
`webapprouting.kubernetes.azure.com`.

Two pieces are wired by `deploy.mjs` after Flux reconciles the Portal
manifests, because they depend on runtime state Bicep can't observe:

1. **Internal LB.** `deploy.mjs` patches the cluster-scoped
   `nginxingresscontroller/default` CR with
   `spec.loadBalancerAnnotations.service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-load-balancer-internal=true`.
   The addon controller propagates the annotation onto the underlying
   `app-routing-system/nginx` Service, and Azure recreates the LB as
   internal-only.
2. **Private DNS A record.** `deploy.mjs` polls the Service for its
   internal IP, then idempotently upserts an A record
   `${HOST}` → internal-LB IP on the Bicep-provisioned Private DNS Zone
   (`PRIVATE_DNS_ZONE`). Re-running the Portal deploy refreshes the
   record if the LB IP changes.

Callers reach the Portal at `https://${HOST}.${PRIVATE_DNS_ZONE}` from
inside the AKS VNet (or any VNet linked to the same Private DNS Zone:
peered VNets, Bastion-attached jump boxes, VPN, ExpressRoute). The
zone is **not** publicly resolvable.

### Unsupported Combinations

- **`EDGE_MODE=private` with `TLS_SOURCE=letsencrypt`** — Let's Encrypt
  HTTP-01 needs a public IP for ACME validation; private mode has none.
  DNS-01 against an Azure Public DNS zone is not in scope (we don't
  provision public zones). Use `TLS_SOURCE=akv` (OneCertV2-PrivateCA /
  AME) or `TLS_SOURCE=akv-selfsigned` for private deployments.
- **`EDGE_MODE=afd` with `TLS_SOURCE=akv-selfsigned`** — Azure Front
  Door rejects self-signed origin certs at the TLS validation step.
  Use `TLS_SOURCE=letsencrypt` (free, public CA) or `TLS_SOURCE=akv`
  with a public CA (e.g. OneCertV2-PublicCA).

`new-env.mjs` and `deploy.mjs` both refuse these combos at preflight.

### Optional: VPN Gateway P2S (hybrid AFD + VPN)

The IaC path supports an optional, additive Azure VPN Gateway
(Point-to-Site, OpenVPN protocol, Microsoft Entra ID authentication) that
coexists with `EDGE_MODE=afd`. The VPN tunnel terminates inside the stamp
VNet and reaches the **same AppGw private listener** as the AFD path, with
the **same AKV cert** — so an allow-listed user (through AFD) and an
off-allow-list authenticated user (through VPN) both reach
`https://<PORTAL_RESOURCE_NAME>.<SSL_CERT_DOMAIN_SUFFIX>` and observe an identical
cert chain. The Private DNS A record is keyed on `PORTAL_RESOURCE_NAME` so
it matches the AppGw listener hostname and AKV cert subject;
`RESOURCE_PREFIX` alone is only a backwards-compat fallback when
`PORTAL_RESOURCE_NAME` is empty. This is the "trusted-bypass" pattern for tenant users with a
valid Entra ID token who would otherwise be blocked at the public edge by
operator-defined AFD WAF allow-lists (typically service-tag, IP-range, or
header-based rules that gate the public ingress to a known managed-network
population). VPN is **not** a replacement for any existing edge mode.

#### Architecture

```
                            (allow-listed public user)
                                  ────────────►  AFD Premium
                                                    │  (Private Link)
                                                    ▼
                                            AppGw v2 (private FE, WAF_v2)
                                                    │  (single AKV cert)
                                                    ▼
                                                AKS portal pod
                                                    ▲
                                                    │
                       (off-allow-list authenticated user)
                                  ────────────►  Azure VPN Gateway P2S
                                  Entra ID + MFA   (GatewaySubnet, OpenVPN)
```

Both paths share one AppGw, one WAF policy, one cert. The AppGw WAF
custom-rules pipeline disambiguates them at L7 (see "WAF guard rules"
below).

#### Required preconditions

- `EDGE_MODE=afd` + `TLS_SOURCE=akv` — `validateVpnGatewayCombo()` in
  `deploy/scripts/lib/overlay-contracts.mjs` requires AFD (code:
  `vpn-requires-afd`) and an AKV-family `TLS_SOURCE` — `akv` or
  `akv-selfsigned` (code: `vpn-requires-akv`); `letsencrypt` is
  rejected because ACME HTTP-01 cannot reach a VPN-only client. The
  `akv-selfsigned` variant is **also** rejected end-to-end on AFD stamps
  by `UNSUPPORTED_COMBOS` in `deploy/scripts/deploy.mjs` (AFD rejects
  self-signed origin certs at TLS validation), so the only effective
  combo for the AFD+VPN trusted-bypass is `EDGE_MODE=afd` +
  `TLS_SOURCE=akv`. `private` mode is rejected because the auto-seeded
  WAF guards assume AFD as the public ingress.
- `SSL_CERT_DOMAIN_SUFFIX` must be set — the managed Private DNS zone
  uses it (code: `vpn-requires-domain-suffix`).
- `VPN_CLIENT_ADDRESS_POOL` must not overlap the VNet `VNET_CIDR`
  (default `10.20.0.0/16`); validated against both endpoints (code:
  `vpn-pool-overlap`). Default pool is `172.16.200.0/24` (~250 concurrent
  clients).
- `AZURE_TENANT_ID` must be set — VPN runs in the **same Entra ID tenant**
  as the rest of the stamp (code: `vpn-requires-tenant-id`).
- Tenant admin access to author the Conditional Access policy below.

#### Env vars

| Var | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `VPN_GATEWAY_ENABLED` | `false` | Master switch. `true` provisions the gateway + GatewaySubnet + managed Private DNS zone + Azure Private DNS Resolver inbound endpoint (with its own `/28` subnet), and seeds the WAF guard rules. The Resolver IP is advertised to P2S clients via the parent VNet's `dhcpOptions.dnsServers` (the supported P2S DNS-push path) so the portal hostname resolves through the tunnel without hosts-file edits. |
| `VPN_GATEWAY_SKU` | `VpnGw2AZ` | `VpnGw2AZ`, `VpnGw3AZ`, `VpnGw4AZ`, or `VpnGw5AZ`. Generation2 AZ SKUs only. `VpnGw1AZ` (Generation1) is excluded — silently drops OpenVPN+AAD HardResetClientV2 packets ~5s after TCP accept with no diagnostic event. Non-AZ SKUs (`VpnGw1/2/3`) and Basic are also rejected. |
| `VPN_CLIENT_ADDRESS_POOL` | `172.16.200.0/24` | CIDR assigned to connected clients. MUST NOT overlap the VNet. |
| `VPN_AAD_AUDIENCE` | `c632b3df-fb67-4d84-bdcf-b95ad541b5c8` | Microsoft-registered Azure VPN Client app. Set to `41b23e61-6c1e-4545-b367-cd054e0ed4b4` only on tenants that must interop with older Azure VPN client builds. |
| `APPGW_WAF_CUSTOM_RULES_FILE` | unset | See [AppGw WAF custom rules](#appgw-waf-custom-rules-applies-to-any-afd-stamp) below — a general-purpose facility, not VPN-specific. |

#### Conditional Access policy (tenant admin, required before first connect)

Create one CA policy targeting the Azure VPN Client app:

- **Target app**: `c632b3df-fb67-4d84-bdcf-b95ad541b5c8` (default), or
  `41b23e61-6c1e-4545-b367-cd054e0ed4b4` if you set `VPN_AAD_AUDIENCE` to
  the legacy override.
- **Assignment**: a NAMED users group. Do not target "all users" — every
  Entra principal in your tenant would otherwise inherit VPN reachability
  to the AppGw private FE.
- **Grant**: require **MFA**.
- **Grant**: do **NOT** require device compliance — the OpenVPN client
  cannot satisfy that grant and connect attempts will fail with an opaque
  AAD error.

The post-scaffold reminder block in `new-env.mjs` re-prints these
requirements when `VPN_GATEWAY_ENABLED=true`. The full skill-side
reference lives in `pilotswarm-new-env-deploy` (`Step 4 → Optional: VPN
Gateway P2S`).

#### Distributing the VPN client profile

After the first deploy completes, hand operators the OpenVPN client
profile via one of these paths (in order of preference):

- **Helper script (recommended)**:
  `pwsh -File deploy/scripts/auth/Get-VpnClientProfile.ps1 -EnvName <stamp>`.
  Wraps the `az network vnet-gateway vpn-client generate` call, downloads
  the signed zip, and extracts it under the gitignored
  `deploy/envs/local/<stamp>/vpn-client/` folder. See the
  `pilotswarm-vpn-client-profile` skill for full usage.
- **Azure portal**: `Resource group → <gateway-name> → Point-to-site
  configuration → Download VPN client`.
- **CLI**: `az network vnet-gateway vpn-client generate
  --resource-group <rg> --name <gateway-name>
  --authentication-method EAPTLS`.

All three emit the same `.zip` that imports directly into the Azure VPN
Client app (Windows / macOS / iOS / Android). The profile embeds the
AAD audience and the gateway public IP — re-issue it (`-Force` on the
helper script) if you rotate `VPN_AAD_AUDIENCE`. The XML carries no
per-user credentials; end users authenticate with their own Entra ID
at connect time.

#### WAF guard rules (auto-seeded at priorities 90 / 91 / 92)

When `VPN_GATEWAY_ENABLED=true`, base-infra bicep
(`deploy/services/base-infra/bicep/application-gateway.bicep`) prepends
three custom rules to the AppGw WAF policy's `customRules.rules` array:

| Priority | Name | Action | Match |
|---|---|---|---|
| 90 | `AllowAfd` | `Allow` | `RequestHeaders[X-Azure-FDID] == <frontDoorId>` (threaded from `global-infra`) |
| 91 | `AllowVpn` | `Allow` | `RemoteAddr ∈ VPN_CLIENT_ADDRESS_POOL` (`IPMatch`) |
| 92 | `BlockOther` | `Block` | `RemoteAddr ∈ 0.0.0.0/0` (catch-all) |

Together: AFD-origin-authenticity check (90) + VPN-pool allow-list (91) +
catch-all block (92). The catch-all is belt-and-braces against future
NSG/route changes accidentally exposing the AppGw private FE outside
both paths.

The 90–92 priority band is **reserved**. Operator-supplied rules from
`APPGW_WAF_CUSTOM_RULES_FILE` (next section) MUST start at priority ≥ 100;
the bicep concats them after the auto-seeded set.

When `VPN_GATEWAY_ENABLED=false`, no auto-seeded rules are emitted — a
VPN-off stamp's AppGw WAF policy diff vs a no-VPN baseline is empty.

#### AppGw WAF custom rules (applies to any AFD stamp)

`APPGW_WAF_CUSTOM_RULES_FILE` is a **general-purpose** facility, parallel
to the AFD-side `WAF_CUSTOM_RULES_FILE`, and works on any
`EDGE_MODE=afd` stamp regardless of whether VPN is enabled. Point it at a
JSON array file containing AppGw WAF custom rule objects; the orchestrator
resolves the path (relative-to-repo-root or absolute), parses the JSON,
and threads it into the bicep deploy as `appgwWafCustomRules`.

```bash
# Recommended location (gitignored under deploy/envs/local/<stamp>/):
APPGW_WAF_CUSTOM_RULES_FILE=deploy/envs/local/<stamp>/appgw-waf-custom-rules.json
```

```jsonc
// Example contents — operator priorities start at 100 to leave
// 90–92 free for the auto-seeded VPN guards.
[
  {
    "name": "BlockExploitUA",
    "priority": 100,
    "ruleType": "MatchRule",
    "action": "Block",
    "matchConditions": [
      {
        "matchVariables": [
          { "variableName": "RequestHeaders", "selector": "User-Agent" }
        ],
        "operator": "Contains",
        "matchValues": ["sqlmap", "nikto"]
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

The merge logic mirrors the bicep exactly in
`deploy/scripts/lib/appgw-waf-rules.mjs` so test cases can assert merged
rule shape without shelling out to `az`. Missing-file or non-JSON-array
inputs fail loudly at preflight with a single named diagnostic.

#### Cost and time

- **Cost**: ~$450/month total for a VPN-enabled stamp:
  - ~$280/month for `VpnGw2AZ` (Public IP + gateway hours). Higher AZ SKUs
    (`VpnGw3AZ` / `VpnGw4AZ` / `VpnGw5AZ`) scale linearly — see Azure VPN
    Gateway pricing for current rates. `VpnGw1AZ` (Generation1) and non-AZ
    SKUs (`VpnGw1/2/3`) are excluded — see the SKU notes above.
  - ~$170/month for the Azure Private DNS Resolver inbound endpoint, which
    is co-provisioned with the VPN gateway so P2S clients can resolve
    Private DNS Zone records (e.g. the portal hostname) through the tunnel
    without hosts-file edits. P2S clients cannot reach the Azure-magic
    `168.63.129.16` resolver — that IP only works from inside Azure VMs —
    so the Resolver inbound endpoint sits on a regular VNet IP. P2S clients
    inherit this IP via the parent VNet's `dhcpOptions.dnsServers` block,
    which the gateway pushes at connect time (the classic VPN gateway
    resource has no dedicated DNS-push property — VNet DHCP options are the
    supported path).
- **First-deploy time**: **45+ minutes**. Gateway provisioning is the
  long pole; the rest of the stamp finishes well before the gateway
  reports `Succeeded`. Subsequent param-change deploys are minutes, not
  45+.

### Model Providers (LLM catalog)

The IaC path mounts the worker's model catalog as a kustomize-generated
ConfigMap (`copilot-worker-model-providers`) sourced from
[`deploy/gitops/worker/base/model_providers.json`](../../../deploy/gitops/worker/base/model_providers.json),
exposed to the runtime via `PS_MODEL_PROVIDERS_PATH=/app/config/model_providers.json`.
This is **separate from** the legacy `scripts/deploy-aks.sh` flow,
which bakes `deploy/config/model_providers.ghcp.json` into the image.

Built-in providers in the base catalog:

| Provider | Auth secret (KV → SPC) | Endpoint | When it loads |
|---|---|---|---|
| `github-copilot` | `GITHUB_TOKEN` | `https://api.githubcopilot.com` | Always |
| `anthropic` (direct) | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | `https://api.anthropic.com` | When the key is set (sentinel-tolerant) |
| `azure-foundry`, `azure-kimi` | `AZURE_OAI_KEY` | `__FOUNDRY_ENDPOINT__/openai/v1` | Only when `FOUNDRY_ENABLED=true` |

`__FOUNDRY_ENDPOINT__` is rewritten to the live Foundry account URL
during `--steps manifests` (from the `FOUNDRY_ENDPOINT` Bicep output).
When Foundry is disabled, the placeholder stays in the file and the
worker's catalog loader silently drops the Foundry providers
(`apiKey: env:AZURE_OAI_KEY` resolves to the stripped `__PS_UNSET__`
sentinel, i.e. undefined).

#### Enabling Foundry on a stamp

```bash
npm run deploy:new-env -- <name> --foundry-enabled y
# scaffolds deploy/envs/local/<name>/foundry-deployments.json
# (a JSON array; the stdout banner lists common entries to copy in)

# edit the JSON to your desired model deployments, then:
npm run deploy -- --env <name>
```

`foundry.bicep` provisions one `Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts`
(kind=AIServices) per stamp, each entry as a child
`accounts/deployments`, and writes `azure-oai-key` directly to KV via
co-located `listKeys()`. When `FOUNDRY_ENABLED=false`,
`auto-secrets-sentinel.bicep` writes the `__PS_UNSET__` sentinel into
the same KV secret so the SPC mount still succeeds.

> **Phase 1 only.** Foundry uses key auth; Claude is direct-Anthropic.
> Phase 2 (SDK Entra-mode for Foundry) and Phase 3 (Foundry-hosted
> Claude) are tracked in
> [`docs/proposals/foundry-entra-mode-auth.md`](../../proposals/foundry-entra-mode-auth.md)
> and [`docs/proposals/foundry-hosted-claude.md`](../../proposals/foundry-hosted-claude.md).

#### Per-stamp catalog overrides

Drop a kustomize overlay patch on the
`copilot-worker-model-providers` ConfigMap in
`deploy/gitops/worker/overlays/<overlay>/` to diverge from the base
catalog for one stamp. Keep `__FOUNDRY_ENDPOINT__` in the patched JSON
to keep endpoint substitution; hard-code the URL to opt out.

### Local Development

Local dev outside Azure (e.g. kind, k3d, plain Docker) is **not** part
of the IaC path. Use the legacy local scripts (`./run.sh`,
`scripts/deploy-aks.sh`) for those scenarios. The IaC path assumes an
Azure target.

### Querying Logs (KQL)

The base-infra Bicep provisions a per-stamp Log Analytics workspace
(`<RESOURCE_PREFIX>-log`) and an AKS Container Insights Data Collection
Rule that ships pod stdout/stderr to the workspace using the modern
**ContainerLogV2** schema. This gives you historical, queryable logs
that survive pod restarts — a step up from `kubectl logs`, which only
shows the current and previous container instance.

Find the workspace:

```bash
# From base-infra deployment outputs (set after `--steps bicep`):
az deployment group show \
  -g "$RESOURCE_GROUP" \
  -n base-infra \
  --query "properties.outputs.logAnalyticsWorkspaceName.value" -o tsv
# → <RESOURCE_PREFIX>-log
```

Open the workspace in the Azure portal → **Logs**, and run KQL like:

```kusto
// Last 200 portal log lines
ContainerLogV2
| where PodNamespace == "pilotswarm"
| where PodName startswith "pilotswarm-portal"
| order by TimeGenerated desc
| take 200
| project TimeGenerated, PodName, ContainerName, LogMessage

// Worker errors in the last 1h
ContainerLogV2
| where PodNamespace == "pilotswarm"
| where PodName startswith "copilot-runtime-worker"
| where TimeGenerated > ago(1h)
| where LogLevel in ("error", "warn") or LogMessage contains_cs "ERROR"
| order by TimeGenerated desc

// Pod restarts / OOMKills
KubeEvents
| where Namespace == "pilotswarm"
| where Reason in ("BackOff", "Failed", "OOMKilling", "Killing")
| order by TimeGenerated desc
| project TimeGenerated, Name, Reason, Message
```

Notes:

- **Ingestion lag is ~3–10 minutes.** Tail follow-ups should still use
  `kubectl logs -f` for live debugging; KQL is the historical view.
- **Retention** defaults to 30 days (free tier). Tune via
  `LOG_ANALYTICS_RETENTION_DAYS` in `deploy/envs/local/<env>/env`.
  Up to 730 days is supported; 30+ is billed at the workspace's
  PerGB2018 rate.
- **ContainerLogV2** is the only schema enabled. The legacy
  `ContainerLog` table is deprecated (retiring 2026-09-30) and is not
  populated.
- **Cost.** A small dev stamp typically lands at 1–3 GB/day; ingestion
  is ~$2.30/GB after the free 5 GB/month per workspace. Use the
  `Usage | summarize sum(Quantity) by DataType` query to monitor.

```

Client apps talk to the versioned Web API hosted by the portal — see
[`docs/api/reference.md`](../../api/reference.md). Constructing a client with
`{ store: DATABASE_URL }` still exists but is internal (workers,
portal-host embedding, and internal testing only). Workers always use
`{ store }` — they are trusted backend components with direct database
access.

## Prerequisites

- Azure CLI (`az`) installed and logged in
- `kubectl` configured for your AKS cluster
- An Azure Container Registry (ACR) for Docker images
- An Azure Database for PostgreSQL (Flexible Server)
- An Azure Storage Account (for session blob storage)

## WARNING: Runaway Deployments

**Before deploying**, always check for old worker pods in other namespaces that may still be connected to the same database:

```bash
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -l app.kubernetes.io/component=worker --no-headers
```

Old workers from a previous namespace (e.g. `copilot-sdk` vs `copilot-runtime`) will process orchestrations with **stale orchestration code**, causing nondeterminism errors. Delete any old deployments before deploying:

```bash
kubectl delete deployment copilot-runtime-worker -n <old-namespace>
```

## Step 1: Create Kubernetes Resources

## Prefer The Repo Script

For this repository, prefer the canonical deploy/reset path:

```bash
./scripts/deploy-aks.sh
```

That script refreshes the Kubernetes secret, optionally wipes remote state, builds the SDK, pushes the worker image, and waits for rollout completion.

### Namespace

```bash
kubectl apply -f deploy/k8s/namespace.yaml
```

This creates the `copilot-runtime` namespace.

### Secrets

PilotSwarm's checked-in model-catalog template is [`.model_providers.example.json`](../../../.model_providers.example.json). Workers actually load the local `.model_providers.json`, which is gitignored so teams can keep personal endpoint URLs and similar local details out of source control. The Kubernetes secret only needs the env vars referenced by that real runtime catalog and the worker runtime.

Store your credentials as a Kubernetes secret:

```bash
kubectl create secret generic copilot-runtime-secrets \
    -n copilot-runtime \
    --from-literal=DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:pass@myserver.postgres.database.azure.com:5432/postgres?options=-csearch_path%3Dcopilot_runtime&sslmode=require" \
    --from-literal=GITHUB_TOKEN="ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxx" \
    --from-literal=DUROXIDE_PG_POOL_MAX="10" \
    --from-literal=PILOTSWARM_CMS_PG_POOL_MAX="3" \
    --from-literal=PILOTSWARM_FACTS_PG_POOL_MAX="3" \
    --from-literal=PILOTSWARM_ORCHESTRATION_CONCURRENCY="2" \
    --from-literal=PILOTSWARM_WORKER_CONCURRENCY="2" \
    --from-literal=PILOTSWARM_TURN_TIMEOUT_MS="2700000" \
    --from-literal=PILOTSWARM_LIVE_TURN="0" \
    --from-literal=AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING="DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=..." \
    --from-literal=AZURE_STORAGE_CONTAINER="copilot-sessions"
```

Worker sizing is env-driven:

- `DUROXIDE_PG_POOL_MAX` — `duroxide-pg` provider pool size. Default: `10`.
- `PILOTSWARM_CMS_PG_POOL_MAX` — CMS `pg.Pool` max size. Default: `3`.
- `PILOTSWARM_FACTS_PG_POOL_MAX` — facts `pg.Pool` max size. Default: `3`.
- `PILOTSWARM_ORCHESTRATION_CONCURRENCY` — Duroxide orchestration concurrency. Default: `2`.
- `PILOTSWARM_WORKER_CONCURRENCY` — Duroxide activity/worker concurrency. Default: `2`.
- `PILOTSWARM_TURN_TIMEOUT_MS` — wall-clock cap for one Copilot turn. AKS deployment setting: `2700000` (45 minutes); the SDK fallback is `1200000` (20 minutes). `0` disables it.
- `PILOTSWARM_LIVE_TURN` — set to `1` to publish coalesced in-progress assistant text and reasoning on the generic live plane. Default: off. The portal consumes these values as transient chat state; durable turn events remain the source of truth.

Provider availability in selectors is env-driven at worker startup. If you add or remove a provider key, refresh the secret and restart the workers; changing the checked-in template alone is not enough, and changing the real `.model_providers.json` only takes effect after the updated file is present in the runtime environment.

### Portal Pods

If you also deploy the shipped browser portal, treat it as a separate runtime
surface from the worker pods:

- package the same app plugin into the portal image
- set `PLUGIN_DIRS` in the portal deployment so the web process can read
  `plugin.json.portal`, `plugin.json.tui`, creatable agent metadata, and
  session policy
- keep portal branding in `plugin.json.portal`, using `plugin.json.tui` as a
  fallback or shared source only when that is intentional

If the portal pod cannot see the app plugin, the browser UI falls back to
generic PilotSwarm branding and generic-session creation even when the worker
supports named agents.

The portal process also hosts the versioned Web API — HTTP `/api/v1` and
WebSocket `/api/v1/ws` — used by the SDK's web mode, the
`pilotswarm-sdk/api` package, and `pilotswarm remote --api-url` (see
[`docs/api/reference.md`](../../api/reference.md)). This requires **no new
ingress rules**: the existing portal ingress (path `/` prefix, 3600s
WebSocket timeouts) already covers `/api/v1` and `/api/v1/ws`, and the
readiness probe stays `/api/health`. TUI and SDK users of the deployment
need exactly one value: the portal URL.

Portal auth is provider-based. For the shipped Entra add-on, add these env vars
to `copilot-runtime-secrets` (or the portal deployment env) before restarting
the portal:

```bash
PORTAL_AUTH_PROVIDER=entra
PORTAL_AUTH_ENTRA_TENANT_ID=<tenant-id>
PORTAL_AUTH_ENTRA_CLIENT_ID=<client-id>
PORTAL_AUTHZ_ADMIN_GROUPS=admin1@contoso.com,admin2@contoso.com
PORTAL_AUTHZ_USER_GROUPS=user1@contoso.com,user2@contoso.com
```

Register the portal ingress URL as the SPA redirect URI in Entra. The portal
core does not require Entra specifically, so alternate providers can use the
same deployment slot without changing the portal shell contract.

> **Automating the app registration.** Rather than clicking through the
> Azure Portal, use `deploy/scripts/auth/Setup-PortalAuth.ps1` to create
> the Entra application, register the SPA redirect URI, and (optionally)
> define the `admin`/`user` app roles consumed by the portal authz
> engine. The script requires `-ServiceTreeId` (operator-supplied) and
> exposes `-CreateAppRoles` (recommended for production stamps) and
> `-AssignmentRequired` (advanced opt-in — see caveat in the README)
> switches for role-driven and Entra-level lockdown postures. The
> recommended production lockdown is `-CreateAppRoles` plus role
> assignments in Entra (the role assignment is the allowlist); the
> portal engine is deny-by-default for any signed-in principal without
> a role claim. Full operator docs:
> `deploy/scripts/auth/README.md`. Agent-driven invocation:
> `pilotswarm-portal-app-reg` skill.

Use the canonical `PORTAL_AUTH_*` / `PORTAL_AUTHZ_*` keys only. The portal no
longer reads legacy `ENTRA_*` aliases.

For tenants driving admission from Entra app roles instead of an email
allowlist, see [`docs/portal-entra-app-roles.md`](./entra-app-roles.md)
for the recommended end-state setup (define roles → assign principals
→ rely on engine deny-by-default → optionally enable
`appRoleAssignmentRequired=true` if your tenant allows it without
tripping admin-consent → align CA). In the Roles posture, the role
assignment in Entra **is** the allowlist — do not also populate
`PORTAL_AUTHZ_ADMIN_GROUPS`, since the engine bypasses it whenever the
JWT carries a `roles[]` claim.

Portal authz supports both email allowlists and Entra app-role claims:

- authenticated users whose email appears in the configured admin/user allowlists are allowed in
- authenticated users whose token carries an Entra app-role claim (`admin` / `user`) are decided from that claim; see [`portal-entra-app-roles.md`](./entra-app-roles.md)
- admins manage cluster health, cost and configuration; ordinary users manage their own resources
- ownership enforcement controls session visibility; `AUTHZ_ADMIN_SCOPE=cluster` also applies ordinary ownership/sharing rules to admins, with the system-session exception documented below

### Refresh GitHub Token

The GitHub token expires periodically. To update:

```bash
kubectl create secret generic copilot-runtime-secrets \
    -n copilot-runtime \
    --from-literal=DATABASE_URL="..." \
    --from-literal=GITHUB_TOKEN="$(gh auth token)" \
    --from-literal=DUROXIDE_PG_POOL_MAX="10" \
    --from-literal=PILOTSWARM_CMS_PG_POOL_MAX="3" \
    --from-literal=PILOTSWARM_FACTS_PG_POOL_MAX="3" \
    --from-literal=PILOTSWARM_ORCHESTRATION_CONCURRENCY="2" \
    --from-literal=PILOTSWARM_WORKER_CONCURRENCY="2" \
    --from-literal=PILOTSWARM_TURN_TIMEOUT_MS="2700000" \
    --from-literal=PILOTSWARM_LIVE_TURN="0" \
    --from-literal=AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING="..." \
    --from-literal=AZURE_STORAGE_CONTAINER="copilot-sessions" \
    --dry-run=client -o yaml | kubectl apply -f -
```

The same pattern applies to Azure/OpenAI or Anthropic BYOK keys. If a provider should disappear from selectors, make sure its env var is absent when the secret is reapplied, then restart the deployment and verify the live model surface.

## Step 2: Build and Push Docker Image

### Login to ACR

```bash
az acr login --name <your-acr-name>
```

### Build and Push

```bash
# Build TypeScript first
npm run build

# Build and push Docker image
docker buildx build \
    --platform linux/amd64 \
    -f deploy/Dockerfile.worker \
    -t <your-acr-name>.azurecr.io/copilot-runtime-worker:latest \
    --push .
```

The Dockerfile (`deploy/Dockerfile.worker`) builds a minimal image:
- `node:24-trixie-slim` base
- Production dependencies only (`npm ci --omit=dev --force`)
- Copies `packages/sdk/dist/` and `packages/sdk/examples/worker.js`
- Runs as non-root `node` user

## Step 3: Deploy Workers

### Edit the Deployment

Update `deploy/k8s/worker-deployment.yaml` with your ACR URL:

```yaml
containers:
  - name: worker
    image: <your-acr-name>.azurecr.io/copilot-runtime-worker:latest
```

### Apply

```bash
kubectl apply -f deploy/k8s/worker-deployment.yaml
```

### Verify

```bash
kubectl get pods -n copilot-runtime -l app.kubernetes.io/component=worker
```

Expected output:

```
NAME                                  READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
copilot-runtime-worker-xxxxx-aaaaa        1/1     Running   0          30s
copilot-runtime-worker-xxxxx-bbbbb        1/1     Running   0          30s
copilot-runtime-worker-xxxxx-ccccc        1/1     Running   0          30s
copilot-runtime-worker-xxxxx-ddddd        1/1     Running   0          30s
```

### Check Logs

```bash
kubectl logs -n copilot-runtime -l app.kubernetes.io/component=worker --prefix --tail=20
```

You should see:

```
[pod/copilot-runtime-worker-xxxxx/worker] [worker] Pod: copilot-runtime-worker-xxxxx
[pod/copilot-runtime-worker-xxxxx/worker] [worker] Started ✓ Polling for orchestrations...
```

After a cold start or destructive reset, the workers will automatically recreate the built-in system sessions (`PilotSwarm Agent`, `Sweeper Agent`, `Resource Manager Agent`, `Facts Manager`). A truly empty session list is therefore temporary.

## Reset Remote State For Reproduction Or Replay Cleanup

Deploys never reset data. A reset is a separate, deliberate operation — run it
only when a wipe was explicitly requested:

```bash
./scripts/reset-db-aks.sh --i-understand-this-deletes-all-data
```

This scales workers to 0, wipes the database, and restores the previous
replica count. (Equivalent manual sequence: scale to 0 →
`NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0 node --env-file=.env.remote scripts/db-reset.js --yes`
→ scale back up.)

This drops:

- `duroxide`
- `copilot_sessions`
- `pilotswarm_facts`
- all blobs in `copilot-sessions` when blob storage is configured

After the workers come back, expect the built-in system sessions to be recreated immediately. For replay-sensitive testing, verify that the recreated root `PilotSwarm Agent` is healthy before starting new user sessions.

## Step 4: Connect Your Client

From your application (anywhere that can reach the portal URL over HTTPS):

```typescript
import { PilotSwarmClient } from "pilotswarm-sdk";

const client = new PilotSwarmClient({
    apiUrl: "https://<portal-url>",
    // getAccessToken: async () => "...", // when the portal runs Entra auth
});
await client.start();

// Sessions are processed by AKS worker pods
const session = await client.createSession();
await session.send("Monitor this service every 5 minutes for the next 24 hours");

console.log(`Session ${session.sessionId} is running on AKS`);
```

The client talks to the portal's Web API (`/api/v1` + `/api/v1/ws`) — see
[`docs/api/reference.md`](../../api/reference.md). Direct
`{ store: DATABASE_URL }` construction is internal (workers, portal-host
embedding, and internal testing only); don't use it for client apps.

Or use the TUI in remote mode — the only value you need is the portal URL:

```bash
npx pilotswarm remote --api-url https://<portal-url>
```

Auth is discovered from the deployment: a no-auth portal starts
immediately; an Entra-protected portal opens your browser for an interactive sign-in in the
terminal, with tokens cached at `~/.config/pilotswarm/auth/`. You can also
sign in ahead of time (or check/clear the cache) with:

```bash
npx pilotswarm auth login --api-url https://<portal-url>
npx pilotswarm auth status --api-url https://<portal-url>
npx pilotswarm auth logout --api-url https://<portal-url>
```

No `DATABASE_URL` and no `kubectl` needed — logs stream over the API.
(`PILOTSWARM_API_URL`, e.g. in `.env.remote`, works instead of the flag.)

> **Operator note.** `pilotswarm remote --store "$DATABASE_URL"` still
> works for direct database access, but it is for operators/internal use.
> `--api-url` and `--store` together are an error.

## Scaling

### Horizontal Scaling

Adjust the replica count:

```bash
kubectl scale deployment copilot-runtime-worker -n copilot-runtime --replicas=8
```

Workers are stateless — each polls the PostgreSQL queue for available work. duroxide ensures exactly-once execution.

### Resource Tuning

The default resource requests/limits in the deployment:

```yaml
resources:
    requests:
        cpu: "250m"
        memory: "1Gi"
    limits:
        cpu: "1000m"
        memory: "4Gi"
```

Each worker runs one LLM turn at a time. Increase CPU limits if tool execution is compute-heavy.

### Spot Instances

The deployment includes a toleration for Azure spot instances:

```yaml
tolerations:
    - key: "kubernetes.azure.com/scalesetpriority"
      operator: "Equal"
      value: "spot"
      effect: "NoSchedule"
```

Spot instances are safe because sessions are durable — if a spot node is evicted, the orchestration retries automatically on another node.

## Updating Workers

### Optional cluster-scoped administration

Set `AUTHZ_ADMIN_SCOPE=cluster` on every worker and portal only after deploying
compatible binaries. This requires an authenticated portal and
`AUTHZ_ENFORCE_OWNERSHIP=true`. The default is `unrestricted`; the portal cannot
change this operator setting. Verify health/bootstrap `authz.adminScope` and
worker-registry `info.authz` (policy version 1), and retire old replicas before
declaring activation complete. Roll a separate Web-mode MCP deployment onto
the matching portal image too.

Cluster mode retains all-user token accounting, configuration and admin
read/write access to system sessions. It removes direct private non-system
session/package bypass; the system-mediated backdoor is intentionally deferred
to phase 2. Migration 0075 is additive: do not reset databases or rewrite
owners/shares/ledgers. Rollback is an explicit operator change to
`AUTHZ_ADMIN_SCOPE=unrestricted` followed by a consistent rollout. See the
[mini spec](../../proposals/cluster-scoped-admin.md) for boundaries and tests.

### Rolling Update

```bash
# Rebuild and push
npm run build
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64 -f deploy/Dockerfile.worker \
    -t <your-acr-name>.azurecr.io/copilot-runtime-worker:latest --push .

# Restart pods (pulls latest image)
kubectl rollout restart deployment/copilot-runtime-worker -n copilot-runtime

# Wait for rollout to complete
kubectl rollout status deployment/copilot-runtime-worker -n copilot-runtime
```

In-flight orchestrations are safe during rollouts. If a worker is killed mid-turn, duroxide will retry the activity on another worker after the lock timeout.

### Database Reset

To wipe all orchestration and session state (only when a wipe was explicitly
requested — deploys never do this):

```bash
./scripts/reset-db-aks.sh --i-understand-this-deletes-all-data
```

This drops the `ps_duroxide`, `copilot_sessions`, and `pilotswarm_facts` schemas (plus the legacy `duroxide` schema if present). Use with caution — all in-flight sessions will be lost.

## Troubleshooting

### Workers Not Picking Up Work

```bash
# Check pods are running
kubectl get pods -n copilot-runtime -l app.kubernetes.io/component=worker

# Check logs for errors
kubectl logs -n copilot-runtime -l app.kubernetes.io/component=worker --tail=50

# Verify database connectivity
kubectl exec -n copilot-runtime deploy/copilot-runtime-worker -- \
    node -e "console.log('DB OK')" --env-file=/dev/null
```

### Session Stuck in "running"

A session may be stuck if the activity timed out. Check the orchestration status:

```bash
# From your machine, via the deployment's Web API
# (.env.remote carries PILOTSWARM_API_URL)
node --env-file=.env.remote -e "
    import { PilotSwarmClient } from './dist/index.js';
    const c = new PilotSwarmClient({ apiUrl: process.env.PILOTSWARM_API_URL });
    await c.start();
    const s = await c.resumeSession('SESSION_ID');
    console.log(await s.getInfo());
    await c.stop();
"
```

(Operators with direct database access can construct the client with
`{ store: process.env.DATABASE_URL }` instead — internal use only.)

### GitHub Token Expired

If workers log authentication errors, refresh the secret:

```bash
kubectl create secret generic copilot-runtime-secrets -n copilot-runtime \
    --from-literal=GITHUB_TOKEN="$(gh auth token)" \
    --dry-run=client -o yaml | kubectl apply -f -

# Restart workers to pick up new secret
kubectl rollout restart deployment/copilot-runtime-worker -n copilot-runtime
```

## Sharing An Existing AKS Cluster

Multiple teams or projects can share one AKS cluster. Each deployment gets its
own Kubernetes namespace, secrets, and optionally its own database schemas.

### Option A: Separate Databases (Simplest)

Each deployment uses a different PostgreSQL database on the same server. No code
changes needed — just different `DATABASE_URL`s.

```
Team Alpha: postgresql://user:pass@pg-server:5432/alpha_pilotswarm
Team Beta:  postgresql://user:pass@pg-server:5432/beta_pilotswarm
```

### Option B: Separate Schemas (Same Database)

Use custom schema names to isolate deployments within a single database. Set
`duroxideSchema` and `cmsSchema` on both worker and client (see
[Getting Started → Custom Schema Names](../../quickstart/local.md#custom-schema-names)).

### Setup Per Team

Each team creates their own namespace and secrets:

```bash
TEAM_NS=copilot-alpha

kubectl create namespace $TEAM_NS

kubectl create secret generic copilot-runtime-secrets \
    -n $TEAM_NS \
    --from-literal=DATABASE_URL="postgresql://..." \
    --from-literal=GITHUB_TOKEN="$(gh auth token)" \
    --from-literal=AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING="..." \
    --from-literal=AZURE_STORAGE_CONTAINER="alpha-sessions"
```

Copy and customize the deployment manifests:

```bash
cp deploy/k8s/worker-deployment.yaml deploy/k8s/worker-deployment-alpha.yaml
```

Edit the copy to update:
- `metadata.namespace` → your team namespace
- `spec.template.spec.containers[0].image` → your ACR image

Then deploy:

```bash
kubectl apply -f deploy/k8s/worker-deployment-alpha.yaml
```

### Connect The TUI To A Specific Namespace

Point the TUI at that deployment's portal URL — logs stream over the API,
so no `kubectl` access or namespace/label flags are needed:

```bash
npx pilotswarm remote --api-url https://<alpha-portal-url>
```

If the deployment runs Entra auth, the TUI walks you through a
browser sign-in (or run `npx pilotswarm auth login --api-url
https://<alpha-portal-url>` first).

> **Operator note.** Direct-store mode still works and is where the K8s
> log-tail flags (`-c`/`--namespace`/`--label`) apply:
>
> ```bash
> node packages/app/tui/bin/tui.js remote \
>     --env .env.alpha \
>     --namespace copilot-alpha \
>     --label app.kubernetes.io/component=worker
> ```

### Resource Isolation

For tighter isolation, use Kubernetes resource quotas:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ResourceQuota
metadata:
  name: copilot-quota
  namespace: copilot-alpha
spec:
  hard:
    requests.cpu: "4"
    requests.memory: 4Gi
    limits.cpu: "8"
    limits.memory: 8Gi
    pods: "10"
```
