# Plugin Architecture & Layering Guide

PilotSwarm's plugin system lets you extend every part of the runtime — agents, skills, MCP servers, tools, and model providers — through a layered architecture that separates built-in system behavior from application customization. This guide is the complete technical reference for how plugins are structured, loaded, and merged.

For practical examples, see [Blog 1: Test Swarm CLI](./examples/blog-test-swarm-cli.md) and [Blog 2: Travel Event Scanner SDK](./examples/blog-travel-event-scanner-sdk.md).

## 1. What Is a Plugin?

A plugin is a directory containing any combination of:

| Component | Location | Format |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| Agents | `agents/*.agent.md` | YAML frontmatter + markdown |
| Skills | `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` | YAML frontmatter + markdown |
| MCP servers | `.mcp.json` at directory root | JSON object |
| Metadata + UI branding | `plugin.json` at directory root | JSON |

Agents are optional. Use skills for reusable methods and domain knowledge,
tools/MCP for executable integrations, and agents for authored workflows with
choreography, checks, and expected outputs. A skills-only or integrations-only
package is valid; see [Building Packages](../../building-agent-packages.md)
for the upload format, including packaged worker tools. Model providers remain
deployment/runtime configuration.

`plugin.json` is now used by the shipped UI layers for app branding. In addition to human-readable metadata, it may contain:

- `tui.title` — app title for the terminal/tab and root system-session heading
- `tui.splash` — inline terminal-markup splash text
- `tui.splashFile` — path to a text file containing the splash markup
- `portal.branding.title` — browser portal title shown in the header and shared UI
- `portal.branding.pageTitle` — browser tab title
- `portal.branding.splash` / `portal.branding.splashFile` — browser portal splash markup
- `portal.branding.logoFile` — brand logo shown on the splash, sign-in gate, and signed-in header
- `portal.branding.faviconFile` — optional browser tab icon override; if omitted, the portal reuses `logoFile`
- `portal.ui.loadingMessage` / `portal.ui.loadingCopy` — browser portal startup copy
- `portal.auth.signInTitle` / `portal.auth.signInMessage` / `portal.auth.signInLabel` — browser sign-in screen copy

Flat legacy `portal.title` / `portal.pageTitle` / `portal.loadingMessage` keys
are still accepted, but nested `portal.branding` / `portal.ui` is preferred.

Portal auth itself is configured separately from plugin metadata. The portal
ships with a provider-based auth layer: `none` by default, plus optional Entra
ID and identity-aware proxy support. That keeps a single identity system from
being baked into portal core.

## 2. Three-Tier Loading Model

PilotSwarm loads plugins in a strict four-stage pipeline. Each stage can override or extend the previous.

### Tier 1: System (`packages/sdk/plugins/system/`)

Always loaded. Cannot be disabled. Provides the foundational behavior every session needs.

```text
packages/sdk/plugins/system/
├── agents/
│   └── default.agent.md        # Embedded framework base prompt
└── skills/
    └── html-visuals/
        └── SKILL.md             # discover on demand or explicitly preload
```

The system `default.agent.md` file is special — it becomes the embedded PilotSwarm framework base. It is not treated as an application-overridable `default.agent.md`, and it is never listed as a selectable agent.

**"Always loaded" describes the tier, not its skills.** A plugin's skills are read
into the worker's skill registry. Sessions can discover and load relevant skills
on demand, or an agent can preload a skill by naming it in `skills:` frontmatter
— see [Skills](#5-skills). Undeclared skills remain reusable without a named
agent wrapper. Guidance that every session must have belongs in the base prompt;
methods needed only for some tasks belong in skills.

### Tier 2: Management (`packages/sdk/plugins/mgmt/`)

Loaded by default. Opt out by passing `disableManagementAgents: true` to `PilotSwarmWorker`.

```text
packages/sdk/plugins/mgmt/
├── agents/
│   ├── pilotswarm.agent.md      # Master orchestrator (system agent)
│   ├── resourcemgr.agent.md     # Infrastructure monitoring (system agent)
│   ├── sweeper.agent.md         # Session cleanup (system agent)
│   ├── facts-manager.agent.md   # Facts hygiene (system agent)
│   └── agent-tuner.agent.md     # Agent-prompt tuning (system agent)
└── skills/
    ├── sweeper/                 # Cleanup domain knowledge
    ├── resourcemgr/
    ├── cost-latency-analysis/
    ├── graph-debug/
    └── orchestration-session-lifecycle/
```

Management agents have `system: true` and are started automatically by the worker. They run as long-lived background sessions with their own durable orchestrations. They inherit the embedded PilotSwarm framework base, but they do not inherit application `default.agent.md` overlays.

### Tier 3: Application (`pluginDirs`)

Your custom plugins. Pass one or more directories via the `pluginDirs` option:

```typescript
const worker = new PilotSwarmWorker({
  githubToken: process.env.GITHUB_TOKEN,
  databaseConnectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
  pluginDirs: ["./plugins/my-app"],
});
```

Directory structure follows the same layout:

```text
plugins/my-app/
├── plugin.json
├── .mcp.json
├── agents/
│   ├── default.agent.md
│   └── analyst.agent.md
└── skills/
    └── data-analysis/
        └── SKILL.md
```

An app's `default.agent.md` becomes an application-level overlay layered beneath the embedded PilotSwarm framework base.

### Tier 4: Direct Config (Inline)

Override everything with inline options on `PilotSwarmWorker`:

```typescript
const worker = new PilotSwarmWorker({
  githubToken: process.env.GITHUB_TOKEN,
  databaseConnectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
  skillDirectories: ["./extra-skills"],
  customAgents: [
    {
      name: "reviewer",
      description: "Code review agent",
      prompt: "You are a code reviewer. Be thorough.",
      tools: ["bash", "grep"],
    },
  ],
  mcpServers: {
    "my-api": {
      type: "http",
      url: "https://api.example.com/mcp",
      tools: ["search"],
    },
  },
});
```

---

## 3. Agent Definitions (`.agent.md`)

Agents are defined as Markdown files with YAML frontmatter. The frontmatter declares metadata and the body provides the system prompt.

### Field Reference

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | string | **Yes** | Unique agent identifier. Used for selection and collision resolution. |
| `description` | string | No | Short description shown in agent lists. |
| `tools` | string[] | No | Tool names this agent can access. |
| `skills` | string[] | No | Skill names to preload into this agent's context from the plugin skill directories. |
| `system` | boolean | No | If `true`, agent is auto-started by the worker as a background session. |
| `id` | string | No | Deterministic slug for system agents (e.g. `"sweeper"`). Used to derive a stable session UUID. |
| `title` | string | No | Display name in session lists. Falls back to capitalized `name` + " Agent". |
| `parent` | string | No | Parent system agent's `id`. Makes this agent a child spawned by the parent. |
| `splash` | string | No | Blessed markup banner shown in the TUI when the session is selected. |
| `initialPrompt` | string | No | First prompt sent when a system agent is created. |
| `initialRequiredTool` | string | No | Schema-v3 contract requiring this declared tool to execute during the initial turn. PilotSwarm corrects once, then fails closed. |

### Example Agent File

```markdown
---
name: analyst
description: Analyzes datasets and produces summary reports.
tools:
  - bash
  - write_artifact
  - read_artifact
skills:
  - data-analysis
---

# Data Analyst Agent

You are a data analyst. When given a dataset:

1. Load and inspect the data structure.
2. Compute summary statistics.
3. Write findings to a markdown report using `write_artifact`.
4. Include the `artifact://` link from the write result in your response.

Be concise. Use tables for numeric summaries.
```

---

## 4. Special Agents

### `default.agent.md`

The agent with `name: default` has unique behavior:

- In the embedded PilotSwarm system layer, it becomes the framework base prompt.
- In app plugin directories, it becomes the app-wide default overlay layered under the framework base.
- It is never listed as a selectable agent.
- It defines app-wide rules that should apply to your app's sessions.
- PilotSwarm management agents do not inherit app `default.agent.md` overlays.

### System Agents (`system: true`)

System agents are background sessions started automatically when the worker launches. They require an `id` field, which is hashed into a deterministic UUID so the session persists across worker restarts.

Root system agents (no `parent` field) are started directly. Child system agents (with a `parent` field) are spawned by the parent at runtime via `spawn_agent(agent_name="<name>")`.

Example hierarchy:

```text
pilotswarm (root, system: true, id: "pilotswarm")
├── sweeper (system: true, id: "sweeper", parent: "pilotswarm")
└── resourcemgr (system: true, id: "resourcemgr", parent: "pilotswarm")
```

---

## 5. Skills

Skills inject domain knowledge into the LLM context. They are directories, not standalone files.

Skills load from every configured plugin skill directory into the worker's skill
registry. Two ways a skill reaches a model, and they cost very differently:

1. **Declared (eager).** An agent names it in its `skills:` frontmatter. The
   worker splices `[PRELOADED SKILL: <name>]` plus the whole body into that
   agent's system message, on every turn, for the life of the session.
2. **Discovered (progressive).** `search_capabilities` finds visible static,
   published, and curated skills by goal; `load_skill` returns the selected
   instructions on demand. Existing skill names and `search_skills` remain
   supported. Only the methods needed for the task need to be loaded.

Two consequences worth designing around:

- **Declaring a skill is not free.** Reserve `skills:` for knowledge an agent
  needs on *every* turn. If the model can decide when it needs a skill, let it
  load it. Write the `description` for that decision: it is the one line the
  model sees before choosing.
- **Visibility applies to discovery and loading.** A user-scope package's
  skills are available to its owner's sessions, including generic sessions;
  publishing a skill does not require an agent to declare it. The owner's
  enabled package copy shadows the shared copy with the same name. Explicit
  `skills:` preloads still work and carry their whole body on every turn.

With Base Agent V2, the prompt indexes deployment and session-owner-authored
skills and workflows by metadata. The runtime skill catalog and SDK skill
directories likewise include those sources only. A named agent may still
preload deployment skills and skills from its own package; a shared skill from
another publisher cannot enter that prompt through a declared name collision.
Other users' shared packages remain searchable and can be used when the
session owner explicitly requests them. Base V1 retains the previous catalog.

### Directory Structure

```text
skills/
└── data-analysis/
    ├── SKILL.md          # Required — frontmatter + knowledge body
    └── tools.json        # Optional — declares tool dependencies
```

### SKILL.md Format

```markdown
---
name: data-analysis
description: Knowledge for analyzing structured datasets
---

When analyzing data, follow these steps:

1. Always validate the data schema before computing statistics.
2. Check for null values and outliers.
3. Prefer median over mean for skewed distributions.
4. Report sample size alongside every metric.
```

### tools.json Format

```json
{
  "tools": ["bash", "write_artifact"]
}
```

Dependency metadata is not an access grant. Loading skill instructions does
not attach executable integrations; discover and activate needed permitted
tools/MCP with `use_package`, or declare them on a named agent. Actual session
and deployment restrictions still apply.

### Skill vs. Agent

| Aspect | Skill | Agent |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Purpose | Reusable methods and domain knowledge | Authored workflow and its declared configuration |
| File | `SKILL.md` in a named directory | `*.agent.md` |
| Instructions | Loaded as needed, or explicitly preloaded | Named session prompt; also loadable as reference |
| Tool binding | Loading text grants no tools | Explicit `tools`/`mcpServers` declarations; runtime policy applies |
| Entry point | `load_skill` after discovery | Select by name, or consult with `load_agent_guidelines` |
| Collision | Additive (all directories combined) | Name collision → last tier wins |

When a generic or named session applies another agent's instructions as
reference, it tells the user the authored agent name and any material
adaptations. Loading those instructions does not change identity, execute
`initialPrompt`, start schedules, or inherit permissions. Use direct work or
native tasks for bounded work; use durable sessions for independent ownership,
schedules, work beyond the turn, or an explicit named-entry-point request.

---

## 6. MCP Server Configuration

MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers extend agent capabilities with external tools. Configure them in a `.mcp.json` file at the root of any plugin directory.

The merged `.mcp.json` maps form the deployment **catalog** — configuring a server does *not* grant it to every session. An agent receives a server by naming it in its `.agent.md` frontmatter:

```yaml
schemaVersion: 2
mcpServers:          # named references into the catalog
  - code-search
inheritDefaultMcpServers: true   # also receive the deployment default set
```

Servers tagged `"default": true` in `.mcp.json` form the deployment default set, granted only to agents with `inheritDefaultMcpServers: true` (the tag is PilotSwarm-only and is stripped before configs reach the Copilot CLI). A base (`default.agent.md`) agent may opt in the same way, which applies its grants to every session. Unknown references are dropped with a load-time warning. Direct worker-config `mcpServers` (inline options, tier 4) keep their legacy every-session semantics.

### Format

The file is a JSON object where each key is a server name:

```json
{
  "code-search": {
    "command": "node",
    "args": ["./mcp-servers/code-search.js"],
    "tools": ["search_code", "get_file"],
    "env": {
      "INDEX_PATH": "${SEARCH_INDEX}"
    },
    "cwd": "/app",
    "timeout": 30000
  },
  "remote-api": {
    "type": "http",
    "url": "https://api.example.com/mcp",
    "tools": ["query", "summarize"],
    "headers": {
      "Authorization": "Bearer ${API_TOKEN}"
    }
  }
}
```

### Server Types

| Type | Transport | Key Fields |
|------|-----------|------------|
| `local` / `stdio` | Subprocess (stdin/stdout) | `command`, `args`, `env`, `cwd`, `timeout` |
| `http` | HTTP request/response | `url`, `headers`, `timeout` |
| `sse` | Server-Sent Events | `url`, `headers`, `timeout` |

The `type` field defaults to `local` if omitted and `command` is present.

### Environment Variable Expansion

All string values support `${VAR_NAME}` syntax. Variables are expanded from `process.env` at load time:

```json
{
  "my-server": {
    "type": "http",
    "url": "${MCP_SERVER_URL}",
    "headers": {
      "Authorization": "Bearer ${MCP_TOKEN}"
    },
    "tools": ["*"]
  }
}
```

Unresolved variables expand to empty strings.

---

## 7. Tool Registration (Code Layer)

Tools add callable functions to the LLM's repertoire. Unlike agents and skills (file-based), tools are defined in TypeScript/JavaScript and registered on the worker.

### Defining a Tool

```typescript
import { defineTool } from "pilotswarm-sdk";

const greetTool = defineTool("greet", {
  description: "Greet a user by name",
  parameters: {
    type: "object",
    properties: {
      name: { type: "string", description: "The user's name" },
    },
    required: ["name"],
  },
  handler: async ({ name }) => {
    return { message: `Hello, ${name}!` };
  },
});
```

### Registering on the Worker

```typescript
import { PilotSwarmWorker, defineTool } from "pilotswarm-sdk";

const fetchUrlTool = defineTool("fetch_url", {
  description: "Fetch content from a URL",
  parameters: {
    type: "object",
    properties: {
      url: { type: "string", description: "URL to fetch" },
    },
    required: ["url"],
  },
  handler: async ({ url }) => {
    const res = await fetch(url);
    return { status: res.status, body: await res.text() };
  },
});

const worker = new PilotSwarmWorker({
  githubToken: process.env.GITHUB_TOKEN,
  databaseConnectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
});

worker.registerTools([fetchUrlTool]);
```

### Client-Side Tool References

The client never holds tool handler functions (they aren't serializable). Instead, it references tools by name:

```typescript
const session = await client.createSession({
  toolNames: ["greet", "fetch_url"],
});
```

The worker resolves these names against its tool registry at execution time. This separation is what allows the client and worker to run on different machines.

---

## 8. Model Providers

The model catalog declares provider **types** and model capabilities. Runtime
provider instances carry identity, credentials, defaults, limits, allowances,
and holds in CMS. Do not put live keys in the checked-in catalog.

### File Format (`.model_providers.json`)

> **Easiest way to get started:** Keep the bundled GitHub Copilot type, start
> the portal with a bootstrap key if needed, then create a shared or personal
> provider instance in Admin Console → Model Providers.

```json
{
  "providers": [
    {
      "id": "github-copilot",
      "type": "github",
      "models": [
        { "name": "claude-opus-4.6", "description": "Most capable. Deep reasoning.", "cost": "high" },
        { "name": "claude-sonnet-4.6", "description": "Strong all-rounder.", "cost": "medium" },
        { "name": "gpt-4.1", "description": "GPT-4.1 via GitHub Copilot.", "cost": "medium" }
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "azure-openai",
      "type": "azure",
      "baseUrl": "https://my-resource.openai.azure.com/openai",
      "apiVersion": "2024-04-01-preview",
      "models": [
        { "name": "gpt-4.1", "description": "GPT-4.1 full model.", "cost": "medium" },
        { "name": "gpt-4.1-mini", "description": "Fast, cost-effective variant.", "cost": "low" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

> **Runtime filtering:** A catalog type is not selectable by itself. The model
> picker and `list_available_models` show only shared/personal runtime provider
> instances the viewer can use.

### Provider Types

| Type | Auth | Endpoint |
|------|------|----------|
| `github` | `githubToken` (Copilot API) | Automatic — no `baseUrl` needed |
| `azure` | `apiKey` | `baseUrl` pointing to Azure OpenAI resource |
| `openai` | `apiKey` | `https://api.openai.com/v1` |
| `anthropic` | `apiKey` | `https://api.anthropic.com` |

### Credentials

Credentials are write-only runtime provider data. Create shared/personal
instances through Admin Console or `PilotSwarmManagementClient`; never check
credentials into the model catalog. `env:VAR_NAME` references in legacy local
catalogs remain bootstrap compatibility only.

### Qualified Model Names

Models are identified by runtime `provider:model` strings (for example
`team-copilot:claude-opus-4`). Bare model names resolve only when exactly one
eligible provider serves them; ambiguous names are rejected with candidates.

### Discovery Order

1. **Explicit path** — `modelProvidersPath` option on `PilotSwarmWorker`
2. **Auto-discover** — searches for `.model_providers.json` in the current working directory, parent directories (up to 5 levels), and `/app/`
3. **Environment variable fallback** — builds a config from `LLM_ENDPOINT`, `LLM_API_KEY`, `GITHUB_TOKEN` (legacy, for backwards compatibility)

---

## 9. Loading Order & Merge Semantics

The complete loading pipeline:

```text
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Tier 1: System plugins (always)                    │
│    → embedded framework base prompt                 │
│    → skills/html-visuals  (registry only)           │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Tier 2: Management plugins (unless disabled)       │
│    → pilotswarm, sweeper, resourcemgr agents        │
│    → sweeper, resourcemgr, graph-debug, …           │
│      (registry only)                                │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Tier 3: Application plugins (pluginDirs)           │
│    → custom agents, skills, MCP servers             │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Tier 4: Direct config (inline options)             │
│    → skillDirectories, customAgents, mcpServers     │
│      (inline mcpServers: every session — legacy;    │
│       plugin .mcp.json: catalog, per-agent opt-in)  │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Prompt composition                                 │
│    → framework base + app default + agent + runtime │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Collision Rules

| Component | Collision Behavior |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Agents | Name collision → **later tier wins** (agent is replaced) |
| Skills | Directories are additive, but the registry is keyed by skill **name** → **later tier wins** (an app skill named `sweeper` replaces the mgmt one) |
| MCP servers | Name collision → **later tier wins** (server config is replaced) |
| Tools | Last `registerTools()` call wins for the same tool name |
| `default.agent.md` | Embedded framework base plus optional app overlay |

### Prompt Composition

PilotSwarm composes system prompts with explicit layers:

```text
[PilotSwarm framework base]
[app default.agent.md overlay, if any]
[active agent prompt, if any]
[runtime context overlay, if any]
```

Those layers are now mapped into the GitHub Copilot SDK's structured system-prompt sections rather than concatenated into one monolithic string. This does not change how apps organize `default.agent.md`, named agents, or skills on disk; it only changes how the runtime feeds those layers to the SDK.

PilotSwarm's own management agents use:

```text
[PilotSwarm framework base]
[management agent prompt]
```

---

## 10. Best Practices

**Keep plugins focused.** Each plugin directory should represent a single application or feature domain. Don't mix unrelated agents and skills in the same directory.

**Use the embedded framework layer for invariants.** If a rule must apply to every session without exception, keep it in PilotSwarm's embedded framework prompt. Use your app's `default.agent.md` for app-wide overlays.

**Choose the artifact that fits the capability.** Extract reusable methods and
domain knowledge into discoverable skills. Put executable integrations in
tools/MCP. Use agents for authored workflows, without requiring a named wrapper
for every skill or tool.

**Name tools descriptively.** Tool names are string references that flow through duroxide serialization. Names like `fetch_url` are better than `f` or `tool1`.

**Use `env:` for secrets.** Never hardcode API keys in `model_providers.json` or `.mcp.json`. Use `env:VAR_NAME` and `${VAR_NAME}` syntax respectively.

**Disable management agents in tests.** Set `disableManagementAgents: true` to avoid spawning sweeper and resource manager during integration tests.

**Use `plugin.json` for documentation and TUI branding.** It remains the right place to record your plugin's name, version, and author, and the CLI/TUI also reads it for app title and splash configuration.

```json
{
  "name": "travel-scanner",
  "description": "Event scanning and itinerary planning tools for travel apps.",
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "author": "Your Name"
}
```

**Test tool handlers independently.** Since tools are plain async functions wrapped in `defineTool()`, you can unit test them without standing up a full PilotSwarm worker.
