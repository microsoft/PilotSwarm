# TUI Design And Implementor Guide

This guide is the detailed contributor reference for the current PilotSwarm terminal UI.

Use it when you are:

- changing layout, rendering, or key handling
- adding a new pane, modal, or command
- debugging session refresh, scroll, or activity behavior
- deciding which layer should own a TUI behavior

This guide covers the current implementation built on Ink in [`packages/app/tui/`](../../../packages/app/tui), but "Ink" is now an implementation detail of the one shipped terminal UI.

## Read This With

- [TUI Architecture](../../architecture/tui.md)
- [Keybindings](../../user-guide/keybindings.md)
- [Working On PilotSwarm](./working-on-pilotswarm.md)

## Mental Model

Authorization is server-owned. In Web mode `AUTHZ_ADMIN_SCOPE=cluster` keeps
admin configuration, accounting and system-session access, but does not grant
direct access to other private sessions/packages. Carry `adminScope` from
bootstrap/profile through shared selectors; use current package `canEdit`
instead of raw role checks. The policy label is read-only. Revocation clears
content and invalidates pending responses; package identity includes scope and
owner, not just name. See [the mini spec](../../proposals/cluster-scoped-admin.md).

The TUI has three layers with a strict ownership split:

```text
terminal input / process lifecycle / clipboard / OS services
                           │
                           ▼
                 packages/app/tui  (host)
                           │
                           ▼
               packages/app/ui/react  (shared tree)
                           │
                           ▼
                packages/app/ui/core  (behavior)
                           │
                           ▼
         PilotSwarm transport + management/runtime APIs
```

The most important rule is:

- `ui-core` decides what the UI means
- `ui-react` decides how the shared app is composed
- `packages/app/tui` decides how that shared app is rendered and controlled in a terminal

If a fix can live below `packages/app/tui`, it usually should.

## Source Map

For streaming chat, follow the [live-plane contract](../../architecture/live-plane.md).
Keep keys stable when the first message ID arrives, cache unchanged history
items, and keep the preview disclosure/scroll viewport mounted through saved
interim output and final promotion. Only a successful turn boundary identifies
the final answer; include these boundaries in chat-history paging. Test the
actual DOM (including expansion, paused inner scrolling, reasoning and tables).
Idle cleanup must be stream-scoped and tolerate independent durable/live
delivery order. Closed reasoning must not repeatedly parse hidden markdown.

### Terminal host

- [`packages/app/tui/bin/tui.js`](../../../packages/app/tui/bin/tui.js) — CLI entrypoint
- [`packages/app/tui/src/bootstrap-env.js`](../../../packages/app/tui/src/bootstrap-env.js) — env, plugin, branding, mode resolution
- [`packages/app/tui/src/index.js`](../../../packages/app/tui/src/index.js) — host bootstrap, render lifecycle, shutdown
- [`packages/app/tui/src/app.js`](../../../packages/app/tui/src/app.js) — terminal input wiring, keybindings, modal dispatch, quit flow
- [`packages/app/tui/src/platform.js`](../../../packages/app/tui/src/platform.js) — terminal rendering primitives, pane frames, scrollbars, prompt drawing, selection
- [`packages/app/tui/src/node-sdk-transport.js`](../../../packages/app/tui/src/node-sdk-transport.js) — SDK/management/log/artifact bridge
- [`packages/app/tui/src/embedded-workers.js`](../../../packages/app/tui/src/embedded-workers.js) — local-mode worker bootstrap

### Shared UI behavior

- [`packages/app/ui/core/src/state.js`](../../../packages/app/ui/core/src/state.js) — initial state shape
- [`packages/app/ui/core/src/reducer.js`](../../../packages/app/ui/core/src/reducer.js) — pure state transitions
- [`packages/app/ui/core/src/controller.js`](../../../packages/app/ui/core/src/controller.js) — async flows and command handling
- [`packages/app/ui/core/src/commands.js`](../../../packages/app/ui/core/src/commands.js) — command ids, tabs, focus regions
- [`packages/app/ui/core/src/selectors.js`](../../../packages/app/ui/core/src/selectors.js) — visible view models and pane lines
- [`packages/app/ui/core/src/history.js`](../../../packages/app/ui/core/src/history.js) — CMS/live event normalization into chat/activity
- [`packages/app/ui/core/src/formatting.js`](../../../packages/app/ui/core/src/formatting.js) — markdown and terminal-markup parsing
- [`packages/app/ui/core/src/layout.js`](../../../packages/app/ui/core/src/layout.js) — pane sizing, focus traversal, prompt row math

### Shared composition

- [`packages/app/ui/react/src/components.js`](../../../packages/app/ui/react/src/components.js) — app shell, panes, modals
- [`packages/app/ui/react/src/platform.js`](../../../packages/app/ui/react/src/platform.js) — host platform context
- [`packages/app/ui/react/src/use-controller-state.js`](../../../packages/app/ui/react/src/use-controller-state.js) — store subscription hook

## Runtime Boot Flow

```text
run.sh / npm run tui / npx pilotswarm
        │
        ▼
packages/app/tui/bin/tui.js
        │
        ▼
bootstrap-env.js
        │
        ├─ resolve env file
        ├─ resolve plugin dirs and worker module
        ├─ resolve local vs remote mode
        └─ resolve branding/splash
        │
        ▼
index.js
        │
        ├─ setup host runtime logging
        ├─ create terminal platform
        ├─ create NodeSdkTransport
        ├─ create ui-core store + controller
        └─ render SharedPilotSwarmApp through Ink
```

Important implication:

- startup logic belongs in `packages/app/tui/src/index.js` and `bootstrap-env.js`
- shared app state should not be created in React components

## Input Pipeline

The terminal host owns raw input.

```text
keyboard / mouse
      │
      ▼
packages/app/tui/src/app.js
      │
      ├─ terminal-only shortcuts
      ├─ modal editing
      ├─ prompt editing
      ├─ focus/tab routing
      └─ controller.handleCommand(...)
               │
               ▼
      packages/app/ui/core/src/controller.js
               │
               ▼
             reducer
               │
               ▼
            selectors
               │
               ▼
          rendered panes
```

### What belongs in `app.js`

- translating raw `ink` key events into commands
- terminal-only affordances like mouse drag selection
- quit/ctrl-c handling
- prompt editing keystrokes
- modal text input wiring

### What does not belong in `app.js`

- deciding how a session row should look
- constructing activity/chat lines
- session refresh semantics
- artifact/file list derivation

If a behavior is currently implemented in `app.js` and also matters for portal or tests, it probably wants to move downward.

## Rendering Pipeline

The shared layers produce line models, not direct terminal widget mutations.

```text
state
  │
  ▼
selectors.js
  │   returns:
  │   - pane titles
  │   - body lines
  │   - sticky lines
  │   - modal models
  ▼
components.js
  │
  ▼
platform.Panel / platform.Lines / platform.TextInput
  │
  ▼
packages/app/tui/src/platform.js
  │
  ├─ wrap
  ├─ trim
  ├─ scroll
  ├─ selection highlighting
  ├─ scrollbars
  └─ Ink <Text>/<Box> output
```

This split is why most visible regressions are easiest to debug by asking:

1. Did `selectors.js` generate the wrong model?
2. Or did `platform.js` render a correct model incorrectly?

## State Model

The state tree is intentionally UI-oriented.

High-value areas:

- `state.connection` — mode, status, connection errors
- `state.sessions` — catalog, active session, flat tree, collapse state
- `state.history` — per-session normalized event/chat/activity data
- `state.ui` — focus region, inspector tab, modal state, scroll offsets, prompt draft
- `state.files` — artifacts, previews, browser scope, selection

Rules:

- Reducers should stay pure.
- Async calls live in the controller or transport.
- Selectors should consume normalized state, not reach into transports.

## Commands, Focus, And Tabs

The command registry in [`packages/app/ui/core/src/commands.js`](../../../packages/app/ui/core/src/commands.js) is the shared vocabulary for the app.

When you add a new command:

1. add or update the command id in `commands.js`
2. handle it in `controller.js`
3. wire the keybinding in `packages/app/tui/src/app.js`
4. update visible help in `selectors.js`
5. update [Keybindings](../../user-guide/keybindings.md)
6. update [.github/copilot-instructions.md](../../../.github/copilot-instructions.md) and the TUI skill if the maintenance rule changed

The TUI treats focus as explicit state, not as terminal-widget magic. Focus movement should go through shared focus regions and layout helpers, not hard-coded panel assumptions.

## Chat And Activity Semantics

`history.js` is where raw events become human-facing chat and activity.

That means:

- deduping live and persisted messages belongs there
- system-card extraction belongs there or in formatting/selectors
- activity summarization belongs there
- ephemeral streaming/noise filtering belongs there

Asked/answered runtime wrappers have legacy and multi-writer forms (the latter
adds `(answered by …)`). Parse both in shared history for rendering and
optimistic reconciliation. The question renders as a Question card, not as
human-authored prose; the event's sender metadata remains authoritative.

Retry warnings must survive CMS/detail status churn regardless of provider
error wording. Stable message/card keys preserve the mounted browser card as
the retry count changes. Recovery resolves the active error status, not its
history. Keep warnings in chronological position, with later chat below them.
Durable `session.error` events render in chat and survive backward paging.
Status-only notices are captured once in shared state and reconciled with
their durable event; never append the current error after every new message.

Session creation seeds its response into the catalog and uses explicit
navigation so filters and stale catalog pages cannot select an older row.
Preserve the outgoing draft. A completed older load must not replace the new
session's subscription. The browser returns to chat from other views without
changing saved Master of Agents layouts.

The browser composer measures wrapped text with `scrollHeight`. An empty
textarea measures its placeholder too. Recompute when the placeholder changes
(especially outbox acknowledgement), not just when the draft changes.

Do not put event-shape interpretation in `components.js`.

A good test for ownership:

- if portal would want the same timeline semantics, put it in `history.js`
- if only the terminal cares about the visual treatment, put it in `platform.js`

## Files, Artifacts, And Preview

The artifact pipeline has three layers:

```text
NodeSdkTransport
   │  list/download/open/upload
   ▼
controller.js
   │  refresh selection, preview load, modal flow
   ▼
selectors.js
   │  file browser list + preview model
   ▼
components.js / platform.js
```

Rules:

- artifact I/O belongs in the transport
- selected-file and preview behavior belongs in the controller
- rendered file list/preview lines belong in selectors
- host-specific "open in OS default app" belongs in `packages/app/tui`

## Scroll And Selection

Scroll offsets are shared state. Selection highlighting is host rendering.

Mobile session-list touch dragging is browser-host behavior: lock to one axis,
track the finger, and stop immediately on release/cancel with no momentum.
Keep tap selection and deliberate horizontal panning. Do not apply this rule
to chat or canvas scrolling, or to desktop drag-to-reorder.

That split matters:

- whether a pane should be bottom-anchored is a shared behavior question
- how a scrollbar is drawn is a host question
- mouse drag region extraction is a host question
- which pane a copy operation applies to is part host, part shared frame registration

If scroll behavior is wrong, inspect:

- `controller.js` for offset updates
- `selectors.js` for sticky/body line counts
- `platform.js` for clipping/wrapping/scrollbar math

## Modals

The TUI uses a shared modal model rather than host-owned ad hoc dialogs.

Pattern:

1. controller opens modal by dispatching shared modal state
2. selectors derive display text/options/footer help
3. `components.js` chooses the matching shared modal shell
4. `app.js` routes keystrokes while the modal is open

If you add a modal, keep all four pieces in sync.

## Local Vs Remote Mode

The host supports two runtime shapes:

- local: embedded workers started by `embedded-workers.js`
- remote: management/client-only TUI with log streaming and no local workers

The view layer should not fork heavily for these modes. Prefer:

- transport capability checks
- state/selector differences
- generic status messages

Avoid host-only branches in many files unless the behavior is truly different.

## Common Change Patterns

### Add a new inspector tab

Touch:

- `commands.js`
- `state.js`
- `controller.js`
- `selectors.js`
- `components.js`
- `app.js` if keybindings/help change

### Add a new session-row badge

Usually touch:

- `selectors.js`
- maybe `context-usage.js` or another shared helper
- docs if the badge is user-visible and meaningful

### Change prompt editing

Usually touch:

- `app.js` for keys
- `controller.js` / `reducer.js` for prompt state changes
- `layout.js` for prompt row math
- `platform.js` for cursor and multi-line rendering
- `selectors.js` for hint text

### Change a visible chat/activity rule

Usually touch:

- `history.js`
- `formatting.js`
- `selectors.js`
- tests first, then platform only if rendering is the actual problem

## What To Avoid

- Do not rebuild shared view state inside React components.
- Do not add terminal escape parsing to selectors.
- Do not let the transport mutate view state directly.
- Do not hard-code keybinding copy in multiple places without updating all help surfaces.
- Do not treat the host as the source of truth for session semantics.

## Debugging Checklist

When a TUI bug shows up, narrow it quickly:

### Wrong text/content

- inspect `history.js`
- inspect `selectors.js`
- inspect controller state snapshots

### Wrong wrapping, clipping, cursor, or scrollbar

- inspect `packages/app/tui/src/platform.js`

### Wrong key behavior

- inspect `packages/app/tui/src/app.js`
- inspect command handling in `controller.js`

### Wrong modal behavior

- inspect `state.js`, `controller.js`, `selectors.js`, and `components.js` together

### Wrong local vs remote startup behavior

- inspect `bootstrap-env.js`
- inspect `index.js`
- inspect `node-sdk-transport.js`

## Validation Checklist

For most TUI changes, do at least these:

```bash
node --input-type=module -e "await import('./packages/app/tui/src/index.js'); await import('./packages/app/tui/src/platform.js'); await import('./packages/app/ui/react/src/components.js'); await import('./packages/app/ui/core/src/selectors.js')"
node packages/app/tui/bin/tui.js --help
```

And then at least one of:

- targeted selector/controller/history Vitest coverage
- `./run.sh local --db` for real interaction changes
- `./run.sh remote` for remote/log/management changes
