# Workflow Generator lifecycle state machines

## Purpose and audience

This document defines the architecture and behavioral contract for publishing,
resolving, executing, and observing durable Workflow Run state machines. It is intended
for PilotSwarm architects and engineers implementing lifecycle source loading,
policy, persistence, workers, transitions, waits, notifications, APIs, and
portal experiences. It also provides profile owners and advanced lifecycle
authors with the conceptual model and ownership boundaries their definitions
must follow.

This is a forward-looking design rather than an operations guide or a
step-by-step end-user authoring tutorial. The currently implemented
Workflow Generator discovery, materialization, provider, and controller behavior is
documented in [Workflow Generator controller](./workflow-generators.md).

## Status

This document describes the target lifecycle architecture for durable Workflow Runs
created by a Workflow Generator. The current implementation includes Workflow Run discovery,
exactly-once materialization, definition pinning, state runs, Workflow Run session
history, versioned Markdown-backed state execution, the Workflow Run journal, constrained atomic
transitions, durable Workflow Run waits, and infrastructure-owned external
operations. Newly published definitions resolve and validate their complete
reachable graph and persist an immutable state-machine snapshot before any
Workflow Run can reference that definition.

### Immutable definition snapshots

Publishing a Workflow Definition resolves every lifecycle source's mutable
`requestedRef`, walks every state reachable from the initial state, validates
all transitions, and stores the exact Markdown, source provenance, transitions,
and canonical snapshot hash in the durable catalog. The Workflow Definition is
immutable; a Workflow Run pins that version when it is created.

Retries, waits, replacement workers, and subsequently entered states execute
the same durable snapshot without re-reading the source repository. Updating a
branch or state file requires publishing another Workflow Definition version;
only Workflow Runs created against that version observe the change. Git commit,
path, and per-state digest remain provenance, while the stored content is the
execution source of truth.

Definitions published before immutable snapshots were introduced retain the
legacy state-entry resolution path for compatibility.

Successor sessions receive ordered journal summaries and can call
`read_job_source_session` with a journal entry's source Session ID to page
through that prior session's durable execution events. The catalog authorizes
the read from the current Workflow Run session association and exposes only sessions
already referenced by the same Workflow Run's journal.

## Summary

A Workflow Generator discovers source records and materializes durable Workflow Runs. Each Workflow Run
then progresses through a durable state machine. State instructions are
authored as Markdown and remain in their separate user and platform sources.
Publication compiles those sources into one immutable definition snapshot.
When a worker activates or resumes a state run, it loads the current state's
exact Markdown and transitions from the snapshot pinned by the Workflow Run.

The state loader is generic. It does not hardcode a particular state machine or
repository. Each resolved source provides a safe base path and filename prefix,
so the current state resolves conventionally to
`<basePath>/<filePrefix>.<state>.md`. Lifecycle profiles and policies will
determine which states exist, who may author them, and where extension
boundaries occur.

The authoring Markdown remains the source material. The durable execution source
of truth is the compiled state-machine snapshot persisted with the immutable
Workflow Definition. The snapshot contains exact state content, transitions,
resolved source coordinates, and a canonical hash.

Workers execute state runs, but the catalog remains authoritative for leases,
allowed transitions, state revisions, idempotency, and history. A worker may
disappear while a Workflow Run is parked on a response, observed-condition, or timer
wait; another worker can later resume the same durable state run.

## TL;DR

1. The platform defines reusable state-machine profiles with explicit
   extension points that repositories and users can plug into.
2. A user supplies the domain-specific behavior for the extension points they
   are allowed to control, such as how to diagnose and propose a fix for a
   particular class of bug.
3. The platform pins the user source and selected profile versions without
   copying their Markdown into a combined artifact.
4. Workers execute the concrete state machine autonomously. The catalog, not
   an individual worker, remains authoritative for state and transitions.
5. Execution alternates between active work, such as LLM prompts and tools,
   and durable response, observed-condition, or timer waits.
6. Workflows dehydrate during waits. They do not retain a worker, process, or
   in-memory call stack while waiting, and any eligible worker may resume them
   after the wake condition is satisfied.
7. Human participation does not define a wait kind. A response submitted
   through PilotSwarm satisfies a response wait; a human action recorded in an
   authoritative provider satisfies an observed-condition wait.

The normal operating mode is autonomous execution. Human interaction is an
exception represented as durable, observable blocked work rather than a
required step between every state.

## Goals

- Let authors describe state behavior in readable Markdown.
- Keep transition syntax small and deterministic.
- Support repository-specific, platform-provided, and user-defined state
  machines.
- Compose user-authored fragments with platform-owned lifecycle profiles.
- Pin every Workflow Run to an immutable effective lifecycle.
- Execute state runs on any eligible worker without worker affinity.
- Dehydrate workflows during response, observed-condition, and timer waits.
- Reuse durable session suspension for response waits.
- Enforce transitions atomically in the catalog.
- Preserve a durable Workflow Run journal between state runs so knowledge learned in one
  state is available to the next.
- Expose current state, waits, ownership, and history in the portal.
- Notify responsible humans when their input blocks an otherwise autonomous
  workflow.
- Preserve exactly-once Workflow Run materialization independently of state execution.

## Non-goals

- Inferring transitions from unstructured agent prose.
- Requiring authors to write a YAML state-machine schema.
- Letting agents or clients submit arbitrary destination states.
- Keeping a worker process alive while waiting for a person.
- Allowing a mutable branch to change the lifecycle of an existing Workflow Run.
- Building a separate human-input system alongside the existing session
  `ask_user` behavior.
- Requiring a graphical state-machine editor for the initial implementation.

The state machine belongs to the Workflow Run. A session is execution history for a
state run; it is not the Workflow Run itself and does not own authoritative Workflow Run state.

## Authoring model

### Files

An authored lifecycle starts with one root file and one file per authored
state:

```text
Example.workflow.md
Example.WorkDetailsGathered.md
Example.Diagnosed.md
```

The root file identifies the initial state and, when required by policy, the
handoff to another lifecycle fragment:

```markdown
# Example lifecycle

## Initial state

[WorkDetailsGathered](./Example.WorkDetailsGathered.md)

## Platform handoff

`FixProposed`
```

A state file contains the instructions for that state and its possible next
states:

```markdown
# Work details gathered

Review the available details. Ask the user for any information required to
confirm a diagnosis.

## Possible next states

- [Diagnosed](./Example.Diagnosed.md) - the diagnosis is supported.
- [WorkDetailsGathered](./Example.WorkDetailsGathered.md) - more details are required.
```

Local Markdown links identify states owned by the same fragment. A declared
handoff state may be referenced by its canonical state name without requiring
the author to provide a file for that state.

### Authors describe outcomes, not tools

Lifecycle authors describe:

- What the agent should accomplish in the state.
- When human input is required.
- What should be captured in the transition summary.
- Which outcomes are possible.

Authors do not instruct portal users to perform transitions, and they do not
need to mention the runtime transition tool. During execution, the runtime
injects a `complete_state` tool whose allowed outcomes are derived from the
validated transition contract when that later validation layer is implemented.

### Ownership and composition

State ownership is policy, not loader behavior. For example, one policy may
define:

```text
User-authored diagnostic fragment:
  WorkDetailsGathered <-> Diagnosed -> FixProposed

Platform-owned delivery profile:
  FixProposed -> AutomatedCodeReviewApproved -> Validated -> PRPublished
      -> HumanCodeReviewApproved -> Committed
       |
       +-- significant findings --> Diagnosed
```

Under that policy:

- The user owns instructions and outgoing transitions before `FixProposed`.
- `FixProposed` is the handoff boundary.
- The platform owns instructions and transitions from `FixProposed` onward.
- A user-authored platform state such as `FixProposed.md` or `PRPublished.md`
  is rejected.

This is not a universal loader restriction. Another policy can select a
different handoff, different owned states, or allow a fully user-defined
machine.

## State source resolution, validation, and publication

Publication converts mutable repository and platform content into an immutable
definition by resolving mutable refs, reading the complete reachable graph, and
persisting the compiled state-machine snapshot:

```text
Initial state + resolved user/platform sources
                    |
                    v
Load each reachable <filePrefix>.<state>.md
                    |
                    v
Validate transitions and require exactly one source per state
                    |
                    v
Persist exact Markdown + transitions + provenance + canonical hash
                    |
                    v
Workflow Runs pin the immutable definition version
```

For example, a Workflow Run in `FixProposed` may probe
`HelloWorld.FixProposed.md` in its pinned user source and
`StandardDelivery.FixProposed.md` in its pinned platform profile. If only the
platform file exists, that exact file is executed. A missing state or a state
present in multiple sources is an explicit error.

The source reader returns `null` only when the candidate file is absent. Access,
network, authentication, and source-integrity failures propagate rather than
being treated as absence. Loaded Markdown retains its original content and line
endings and may be cached by immutable source identity, path, and content
digest.

### State loader responsibilities

The initial generic loader must:

- Accept the durable current state and pinned user/platform source metadata.
- Derive a conventional candidate path for only that state in each source.
- Reject duplicate or ambiguous state definitions.
- Reject unsafe source-relative paths and filename prefixes.
- Preserve exact Markdown content and line endings.
- Return the owner, immutable source coordinates, source path, and content
  digest with the loaded Markdown.
- Distinguish a missing file from a source-read failure.

The loader deliberately does not:

- List or load unrelated state files.
- Copy user and platform files into a combined package.
- Parse `## Possible next states`.
- Validate transition targets, reachability, terminals, or handoffs.
- Enforce lifecycle profile ownership policy.
- Produce or persist a compiled graph JSON document.

### Deferred semantic validation

A later publication stage may:

- Parse the initial-state link from the root lifecycle document.
- Parse local next-state links and declared external handoffs.
- Reject missing local link targets.
- Detect unreachable states.
- Detect nonterminal states with no outgoing transition.
- Validate terminal-state and ownership rules.
- Produce stable outcome keys for runtime tools.

Any normalized graph produced for these operations is a derived projection of
the pinned Markdown sources, not a second authoring or storage contract.

### Policy responsibilities

The selected lifecycle policy must:

- Define which lifecycle profiles may be selected.
- Define the official state catalog, when one is required.
- Define which principals may author each state or fragment.
- Define required entry and handoff states.
- Define whether authored states may override profile states.
- Define whether complete user-owned state machines are permitted.
- Define administrative transitions such as cancellation independently of
  user-authored business transitions.

### Profile registry responsibilities

The profile registry stores versioned lifecycle fragments, for example:

```text
standard-delivery@1
repository-specific-triage@2
custom-only@1
```

A profile contains immutable state Markdown, a filename prefix, ownership
metadata, and a version or digest. Updating a profile creates a new version; it
does not mutate definitions or Workflow Runs pinned to an older profile.

### Published lifecycle pins

The immutable Workflow Definition should retain:

```json
{
  "lifecycle": {
    "name": "Example",
    "initialState": "WorkDetailsGathered",
    "policy": {
      "name": "diagnostic-extension",
      "version": 1
    },
    "sources": [
      {
        "sourceId": "example-user",
        "owner": "user",
        "filePrefix": "Example",
        "basePath": "automation/lifecycles/example",
        "kind": "github",
        "repositoryUrl": "https://github.com/example/service-repo",
        "requestedRef": "refs/heads/users/demo/lifecycle",
        "resolvedCommit": "<commit>",
        "digest": "<source-digest>"
      },
      {
        "sourceId": "standard-delivery@1",
        "owner": "platform",
        "filePrefix": "StandardDelivery",
        "basePath": "profiles/standard-delivery",
        "kind": "ado",
        "repositoryUrl": "https://dev.azure.com/example/platform/_git/lifecycle-profiles",
        "resolvedCommit": "<commit>",
        "version": 1,
        "digest": "<profile-digest>"
      }
    ],
    "digest": "<effective-lifecycle-digest>"
  }
}
```

Runtime execution reads files only from these immutable pins. It never reads
the mutable branch represented by `requestedGitRef`; source clients may cache
files by the resolved commit or profile version.

## Required components

| Component | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| Lifecycle source client | Resolve Git refs and read lifecycle files using service authentication |
| Lifecycle state loader | Resolve and read exact `Prefix.State.md` content during definition publication |
| Lifecycle state-machine compiler | Walk and validate the complete reachable graph and produce its canonical immutable snapshot |
| Lifecycle semantic validator | Parse transitions and reject missing, ambiguous, or malformed reachable states before publication |
| Lifecycle policy evaluator | Enforce state catalogs, ownership, profiles, and extension boundaries |
| Lifecycle profile registry | Store versioned platform and repository state-machine fragments |
| Lifecycle publisher | Resolve mutable refs and persist the exact compiled state-machine snapshot in an immutable definition |
| Workflow Generator controller | Discover records, reconcile exactly-once Workflow Runs, and initialize lifecycle execution |
| Workflow Run catalog | Store current state, revisions, leases, runs, transitions, and session associations |
| State-run worker | Execute one leased state run and create or resume its Workflow Run session |
| Session runtime | Run agent instructions and provide durable wait and `ask_user` suspension |
| External-operation adapters | Start and observe builds, tests, deployments, and other asynchronous system work |
| Transition tool | Request one validator-approved state outcome |
| Attention dispatcher | Persist, deduplicate, deliver, and resolve human-attention notifications |
| Portal | Register lifecycle sources and display state, waits, ownership, attention, and history |

These are logical responsibilities. They do not all require separate services.
The loader, validator, and publisher can live with the management API or worker
SDK, and state-run leasing can use the existing PostgreSQL catalog. Attention
delivery should use a durable outbox so a notification failure cannot roll
back or duplicate a Workflow Run-state transaction.

## End-to-end Workflow Run lifecycle

### 1. Register and publish a Workflow Generator

The author supplies:

- Source-provider configuration, such as a WIQL query.
- Cadence and guardrails.
- Repository and Git-ref affinities.
- Lifecycle source repository, Git ref, and root path.
- A lifecycle policy or profile selection when it is not supplied by a
  platform default.

The server resolves mutable lifecycle refs, pins the selected policy and
profile versions, and publishes an immutable Workflow Definition. Semantic
graph validation may be added as a later publication step.

### 2. Discover source records

The Workflow Generator controller leases a due generator, evaluates its source
provider, and reconciles discoveries. Database uniqueness on
`(workflow_generator_id, workflow_run_key)` continues to make this exactly-once across retries.

### 3. Initialize a Workflow Run

A newly materialized Workflow Run is pinned to the active immutable definition and
initialized with:

```text
current_state = effectiveLifecycle.entryState
state_revision = 1
```

The controller or state-run coordinator reserves the first state run. The
source provider is no longer required for that Workflow Run to continue through its
lifecycle.

### 4. Lease and execute a state run

Any eligible worker may lease the runnable state run. The worker:

1. Loads the Workflow Run and its pinned lifecycle sources.
2. Derives the current state's candidate path in each source and loads the
   exact Markdown from the one source that supplies it.
3. Creates or resumes the Workflow Run session associated with the state run.
4. Injects the runtime state-completion protocol.
5. Executes the session.

Workers perform execution but do not decide which transitions are valid. The
catalog and pinned graph remain authoritative.

### 5. Perform active work or wait durably

A state run may alternate between active execution and three durable Workflow Run wait
kinds. Classify the wait by how completion becomes authoritative, not by
whether a human or automation performs the surrounding action:

| Mode | Satisfaction contract | Examples | Worker retained? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Active execution | The current worker completes an LLM, tool, or short API call | Prompt execution, local tool | Yes, while the call runs |
| Response wait | An authorized response is submitted directly through PilotSwarm | Resolve an ambiguity, select an option | No |
| Observed-condition wait | PilotSwarm verifies a predicate in another authoritative system | Build, validation, review approval, PR completion, deployment | No |
| Timer wait | A durable time condition is reached | Retry backoff, scheduled wake-up, deadline | No |

When a state must wait, the runtime checkpoints the workflow, releases the
worker, and resumes only through the corresponding durable boundary:

- `ask_user` persists a response wait owned by the Workflow Run session.
- `start_external_operation` and `system_wait` persist an
  observed-condition wait whose result and evidence are owned by the state
  run.
- The existing Duroxide durable timer remains the wake-up engine for `wait`;
  its start and completion are projected into a timer `WorkflowRunWait`.

Detection mode is separate from wait kind. A response normally arrives by
direct submission. An observed condition may be detected by polling, a
provider event, or a hybrid in which events accelerate detection and polling
guarantees reconciliation. A webhook about PR approval remains an
observed-condition wait because the repository provider, not the webhook, is
authoritative.

A person reviewing or completing a PR acts outside the Workflow Run session, so those
are observed-condition waits rather than response waits. A build, test,
reviewer, or PR owner does not require an agent loop to remain alive and poll
in memory.

Examples of durable wake conditions include:

- A submitted build reaches a terminal status.
- A validation or test suite completes with recorded results.
- An automated code review finishes.
- Required human code-review approval appears in the repository provider.
- An authorized person completes or merges the pull request.
- A change or fix is present on the required target branch.
- A deployment containing the change completes in the target environment.
- A callback or event arrives for a correlation ID.
- A durable polling timer expires.
- A retry or deadline timer becomes due.
- An authorized person submits an answer through the session.
- A person or automation performs the requested action in an external system.

Observed-condition waits should be expressed as durable predicates over
external evidence, not as workers sleeping until a command finishes. For
example, a port wait may track a source commit, target repository, and target
branch until the required change is observed there. A deployment wait may
track an artifact or commit through a deployment system until the intended
environment reports completion.

On wake-up, any eligible worker may lease and resume the state run from its
persisted state.

### 6. Resolve each Workflow Run wait through its authoritative boundary

If state instructions require an answer inside the Workflow Run session, the agent
invokes the existing durable `ask_user` tool. This is a response wait:

```text
Workflow Run current state: WorkDetailsGathered
State run: input_required
Session: input_required
Broad Workflow Run status: blocked
```

The Workflow Run has not transitioned. The worker releases the execution lease and may
process other work. The pending question remains owned by the durable session.

The portal presents the pending question and uses the existing session answer
path. After the user answers, any worker can lease and resume the same state
run and session.

For example, the Workflow Run owner may need to resolve an ambiguity or select among
explicit options before work can continue. PilotSwarm validates the submitted
response against the pending wait identity, responder policy, expected answer
shape, and Workflow Run state revision before making the state run runnable.

For an observed-condition wait, the state records the provider, target
resource, completion predicate, and polling cursor in its durable context,
then invokes `system_wait` with the signal key assigned to that observation.
A PilotSwarm observer claims due checks, polls the provider, persists current
evidence, and publishes the matching signal only after the predicate is
satisfied.

Observed-condition waits include:

- Waiting for builds.
- Waiting for validation.
- Waiting for automated code review.
- Waiting for human code review recorded in the repository provider.
- Waiting for an authorized person to complete or merge a pull request.

The last two remain observed-condition waits because the action occurs outside
PilotSwarm and a provider observer verifies it. No artificial `ask_user`
question is created. The portal should label the predicate specifically, such
as `Awaiting human code review` or `Awaiting PR completion`.

`HumanCodeReviewApproved` is a lifecycle state reached after review approval;
it is not itself a wait type. A subsequent transition from
`HumanCodeReviewApproved` to `Committed` uses a separate observed-condition
wait for PR completion.

A timer wait stores its time condition and deadline in durable state. The
existing Duroxide timer, rather than a provider observer or submitted
response, makes the session runnable when that condition is reached; the
boundary is projected into the canonical Workflow Run wait model.

#### Current implementation status

Response waits are projected into the canonical durable `WorkflowRunWait` model when a
Workflow Run session invokes `ask_user`. The wait records the owning Workflow Run and state run,
expected state revision, question, allowed choices, responder policy, and
direct-submission detection mode. Answer submission satisfies that record
before resuming the durable session; stale, invalid, or duplicate submissions
are rejected, and a failed queue delivery reopens the same wait. Delivery state
is recorded as `pending` or `enqueued` so the acceptance-to-enqueue boundary is
observable. A process crash or ambiguous queue acknowledgement can still leave
a satisfied response in `pending`; a future scheduler/outbox recovery pass must
redrive that state before the platform can claim exactly-once response delivery.

Observed-condition waits are claimed from the canonical `WorkflowRunWait` model with
`SKIP LOCKED` leases. Each check durably records its attempt count, provider
cursor, latest observation, retry error, next-check time, and optional
deadline. A check may remain pending, satisfy the predicate, fail terminally,
or time out. Retryable observer failures use bounded backoff, expired leases
are reclaimable after process loss, and state-revision fencing prevents a late
check from reviving a cancelled or superseded wait. Provider events can
accelerate `event` or `hybrid` waits without replacing polling reconciliation.

The deterministic `mock` observer remains available for demonstrations. The
Workflow Generator also registers a production Azure DevOps pull-request approval
observer. It verifies that the PR still targets the source commit persisted by
the Workflow Run wait, then treats Azure DevOps's current enabled, blocking policy
evaluations as authoritative. Required reviewer identities and effective votes
are retained as evidence. Provider events can accelerate the matching PR check,
but only a fresh authoritative read can satisfy it. The observer also binds the
target repository to the immutable Workflow Run definition's repository affinity through
the server-owned `WORKFLOW_GENERATOR_ADO_REPOSITORY_BINDINGS` map before it acquires or uses
an Azure DevOps credential. A companion `pull_request_completion` observer shares
that client and repository authorization. It verifies the persisted source
commit, satisfies the wait once the PR is `completed`, records an abandoned or
incompatible PR as a terminal disposition, and preserves the merge commit,
completion actor, completion time, and target branch as evidence. Provider events
only accelerate its check; authoritative polling still recovers missed, stale,
reordered, and duplicate events, and the observer never completes, abandons, or
otherwise mutates the pull request. Generic response-delivery recovery remains a
separate implementation slice. When approval must be renewed after each source
push, the repository's Azure DevOps branch
policy must enable vote reset; the observer does not reinterpret a current
policy evaluation that Azure DevOps reports as approved.

Timer waits are now projected into the same model for catalog and portal
observability. Duroxide remains authoritative for durable timer scheduling and
session resumption; the Workflow Run wait scheduler does not create a second timer
engine.

### 7. Complete a state

The runtime generates an internal tool contract from the current state's
allowed outcomes:

```text
complete_state(
  outcome: one of the validated outcome keys,
  summary: string
)
```

Neither the lifecycle author nor the portal user invokes this tool directly.
The agent invokes it after satisfying the state instructions.

The server maps the outcome key to a destination from the immutable graph. It
then applies the transition with a state-revision compare-and-swap. If the
state or revision changed, the request is stale and fails without modifying
the Workflow Run.

State completion also produces one required text `summary`. The catalog writes
the summary as part of the same transaction that commits the transition. The
transition retains the concise context needed by the next state, while its
`session_id` links to the authoritative full execution record when additional
detail is needed. Structured evidence and artifact references are deferred.

If an agent returns prose without successfully invoking `complete_state`, the
state remains incomplete. The platform does not infer a transition from text.

### 8. Enter the next state

A successful transition:

- Appends a state-transition entry to the Workflow Run journal.
- Completes the source state run.
- Updates the Workflow Run's current state and revision.
- Reserves the next state run with a reference to the predecessor journal entry
  when the destination is nonterminal.
- Projects the new state into Workflow Generator hierarchy reads.

The next state normally receives a new Workflow Run session. This keeps state execution
history ordered and lets each session retain the exact instructions and tools
used for that state revision. Before executing the next state's Markdown, the
runtime injects the ordered Workflow Run journal, including each prior transition
summary and originating session reference. Workers can retrieve additional
detail from a durable source session when needed. A response wait resumes the
existing session for the same state run rather than creating a new one.

This handoff must not depend on an in-memory worker conversation. A different
worker must be able to start the next state after a restart and receive the
same persisted context.

### 9. Cross an ownership boundary

When a Workflow Run enters a handoff state, the effective graph selects the instructions
owned by the next fragment or profile. Workers execute user-owned and
platform-owned states through the same mechanism. Ownership affects
publication and portal attribution, not the worker protocol.

For example:

```text
Diagnosed --complete_state--> FixProposed
  user-owned                   platform-owned
```

The Workflow Run remains pinned to the profile version composed at publication time.

### 10. Reach a terminal state

Entering a terminal state atomically:

- Records the final transition.
- Completes the previous state run.
- Sets the Workflow Run's official current state to the terminal state.
- Sets the broad Workflow Run lifecycle status to `completed` or `cancelled`.
- Prevents additional state runs from being leased.

A terminal state may have platform-authored Markdown for documentation or
entry behavior, but it does not require an agent session when no work must be
performed after entry.

## Worker responsibility

Each worker executes the state run it has leased. A worker is responsible for:

- Loading the pinned instructions and transition contract.
- Creating or resuming the associated Workflow Run session.
- Running the agent turn.
- Surfacing durable response, observed-condition, and timer waits.
- Calling catalog operations on behalf of injected tools.
- Reporting explicit execution failures.

A worker is not responsible for:

- Mutating the effective lifecycle.
- Accepting arbitrary destination state names.
- Deciding ownership policy.
- Keeping state only in memory.
- Holding a worker slot during a Workflow Run wait.
- Advancing a state based solely on an agent's final text.
- Overwriting a transition committed by another worker.

The worker that starts a state run does not need to be the worker that resumes
or completes it.

## State and status model

The official state machine and broad operational status answer different
questions.

| Field | Example | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `current_state` | `WorkDetailsGathered` | Official business lifecycle position |
| `state_revision` | `3` | Concurrency and idempotency fence |
| `lifecycle_state` | `blocked` | Broad operational status for scheduling and UI |
| State-run status | `waiting` or `input_required` | Execution status of the current state revision |
| Session status | `input_required` | Durable orchestration status and pending question |

While an interactive-input gate blocks `WorkDetailsGathered -> Diagnosed`, the
Workflow Run remains in `WorkDetailsGathered`. `blocked` is an operational status, not
an official business state. All durable waits project the broad Workflow Run lifecycle
status as `blocked`, which excludes the Workflow Run from runnable work.
`input_required` means the Workflow Run is waiting for an answer through the session.
`waiting` means it is waiting for an observed condition or timer. The matching
signal may represent either a machine-owned predicate, a human action observed
in another system, or a durable time condition. Resuming the same state run
returns the Workflow Run to `active`.

## Persistence model

### Workflow Runs

Extend the existing Workflow Runs table with:

```text
current_state
state_revision
current_state_entered_at
```

The existing broad `lifecycle_state` remains useful for values such as
`pending_session`, `active`, `blocked`, `completed`, and `cancelled`.

### State runs

Add an append-oriented `workflow_run_state_runs` table:

```text
state_run_id
workflow_run_id
workflow_definition_id
state_name
state_revision
state_owner
status
session_id
predecessor_journal_entry_id
attempt
wait_kind
wait_reason
wait_started_at
external_reference
lease_owner
lease_expires_at
started_at
completed_at
error
```

There is at most one active state run for a Workflow Run state revision. A session ID is
reserved before starting session execution so retries retain a durable
association. Except for the initial state run,
`predecessor_journal_entry_id` identifies the journal entry that caused this
run to be created.

`wait_kind` distinguishes `response`, `observed_condition`, and `timer` waits.
Provider-specific correlation data belongs in `external_reference`;
credentials and secrets do not. Detection mode is recorded separately where
an observed condition supports polling, events, or hybrid reconciliation.

### Workflow Run journal

Add an ordered, append-only `workflow_run_journal_entries` table. The MVP requires
state-transition entries, while the journal can later support other durable Workflow Run
events:

```text
journal_entry_id
workflow_run_id
sequence
entry_kind
workflow_definition_id
from_state
to_state
from_revision
to_revision
state_run_id
session_id
outcome
summary
idempotency_key
transitioned_at
```

The journal append and Workflow Run update occur in one database transaction. A unique
idempotency key prevents a replayed tool call from creating duplicate history.
A state-transition journal entry is also the durable state-to-state handoff:

- `outcome` records the transition outcome used to select the destination.
- `summary` is the single free-form text field describing what the state
  learned or produced for the next state.
- `session_id` links to the full prompts, responses, tools, and pending or
  answered questions from the completed state when more detail is needed.

The next state runner loads the ordered Workflow Run journal before creating or resuming
its session. This makes prior summaries available across worker changes,
process restarts, and ownership handoffs.

### Atomic transition

The authoritative update follows compare-and-swap semantics:

```sql
UPDATE workflowRuns
SET current_state = :to_state,
    state_revision = state_revision + 1,
    current_state_entered_at = now(),
    updated_at = now()
WHERE workflow_run_id = :workflow_run_id
  AND current_state = :from_state
  AND state_revision = :expected_revision;
```

The transaction must also verify that the pinned effective graph contains the
requested edge. A zero-row update indicates a stale or competing transition.

### Attention requests

Add a durable attention-request and notification-outbox model:

```text
attention_request_id
workflow_run_id
state_run_id
session_id
state_revision
blocking_principal
question
status
deduplication_key
created_at
resolved_at

notification_outbox_id
attention_request_id
channel
destination_reference
status
attempt
next_attempt_at
delivered_at
```

The transaction that marks a Workflow Run blocked creates the attention request and
outbox record. Delivery happens asynchronously. Resolving the pending question
closes the attention request even if one notification channel is temporarily
unavailable.

## API surfaces

The management API needs:

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/api/v1/workflow-definitions/validate` | Resolve and preview a lifecycle without publishing |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/workflow-generators` | Register a generator and publish definition version 1 |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/workflow-generators/{id}/definitions` | Publish a new immutable definition with pinned lifecycle sources |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/workflow-definitions/{id}` | Read source coordinates, profiles, graph, and digest |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/workflow-runs/{id}` | Read current state, revision, status, and active state run |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/workflow-runs/{id}/journal` | Read the ordered Workflow Run journal |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/workflow-runs/{id}/state-runs` | Read state execution and session history |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/attention-requests` | List unresolved work blocking the current principal |

The existing session messaging endpoint remains the way portal users answer
`ask_user`. There is no public endpoint that lets a user directly force an
arbitrary Workflow Run transition.

Internal catalog operations are also required for:

- Reserving and leasing state runs.
- Acknowledging state-run execution.
- Marking a state run as waiting or failed.
- Completing a state with an allowed outcome.
- Loading the Workflow Run journal and referenced source-session context for a state run.
- Recovering expired state-run leases.
- Creating and resolving attention requests.
- Claiming and completing notification-outbox deliveries.

## Portal experience

### Registration

The registration form should collect:

```text
Lifecycle repository
Git ref
Root lifecycle file
Lifecycle policy/profile
```

Validation preview should show:

- Resolved commit.
- User-authored states.
- Composed profile states.
- State ownership.
- Initial and handoff states.
- Effective transition graph.
- Validation failures.

The server reloads and validates the source during publication even if the
portal already displayed a successful preview.

### Workflow Run hierarchy

The portal should show:

```text
Current official state
Broad operational status
State owner
Pending transition or outcome
Pending human question
Current state session
Previous-state transition summary
Pinned lifecycle digest
Workflow Run journal
```

An input-required Workflow Run could appear as:

```text
State: WorkDetailsGathered
Owner: User lifecycle
Status: Blocked
Pending: Diagnosed
Action: Answer required
```

### Attention dashboard

The portal should provide a principal-scoped view of unresolved attention
requests:

```text
Blocked Workflow Runs
  Workflow Run
  Generator
  Current state
  Blocking question
  Waiting since
  Deadline or escalation
  Open session
```

The dashboard is the authoritative pull experience. Notification channels are
the push experience and should deep-link to the same Workflow Run and pending question.
Users are not expected to monitor every autonomous Workflow Run or manually approve
ordinary state transitions.

After a handoff:

```text
State: FixProposed
Owner: standard-delivery@1
Status: Active
```

## Reliability and recovery

### Worker failure

State-run leases expire. Another worker can reclaim the run and use its durable
session association and stable message IDs to resume or safely retry.
When a transition has already committed, the successor run reconstructs its
input context from the Workflow Run journal and referenced source sessions rather than
from the failed worker's memory.

### Response waits

The session persists the pending question. No worker lease is held while the
session is `input_required`. Answering the question makes the same state run
runnable again. The attention request and notification outbox make the wait
discoverable without making notification delivery part of session correctness.

### Observed-condition waits

The agent starts platform-owned work through `start_external_operation`. The
catalog creates or returns the idempotent operation for the current state run
and generates its operation ID, provider correlation ID, and exact signal key;
the agent cannot supply or invent those identities. The agent then calls
`system_wait` with that returned key.

The Workflow Run wait scheduler claims due observed-condition waits, invokes the
registered provider observer, and persists current observations, cursors,
results, and evidence. Signal delivery remains on the linked external-operation
outbox and has its own durable lease, attempt count, retry time, and completion
marker, so scheduler restarts provide at-least-once delivery without
duplicating the external operation. Authoritative wait-started and
wait-completed timestamps live on the Workflow Run wait row and are mirrored to the
operation row for compatibility. Delivery waits until the exact generated
signal key is durably registered as parked.
Only the exact key thaws the wait; unrelated messages and mismatched signals do
not satisfy it. No worker is pinned while waiting for the external system.

The operation belongs to the state run, not to one disposable Workflow Run session. If a
session is replaced before its wait completes, the same idempotent operation is
rebound to the state run's current session, delivery is re-armed, and the
immutable creating-session reference remains available for attribution.

After resumption the agent reads the durable record through
`get_external_operation`. An `external_operation` validation gate can prevent a
transition until a matching operation has succeeded, its signal has been
observed by the matching durable wait, and evidence has been persisted:

```json
{
  "type": "external_operation",
  "name": "Example validation",
  "beforeState": "Validated",
  "provider": "mock",
  "kind": "validation",
  "requireEvidence": true
}
```

`beforeState` names the destination state being protected. The initial
deterministic `mock` provider supports success and failure outcomes without
pretending that a real external service was called.

### Timer waits

Duroxide persists the timer and resumes the session when it fires. The runtime
projects timer start and completion into the canonical Workflow Run wait model so the
catalog and portal expose the same wait taxonomy without introducing a second
timer scheduler. Interrupted timers cancel their current projection and create
a fresh timer wait if the orchestration resumes the remaining duration. A
process does not sleep or retain a worker while waiting, and timer completion
remains revision-fenced through the current Workflow Run session.

### Duplicate tool calls

The transition idempotency key returns the already-committed result. A
different transition for the same state revision fails the compare-and-swap.

### Definition updates

Publishing a new Workflow Definition affects only subsequently materialized
Workflow Runs. Existing Workflow Runs continue using their pinned source commit, profile
versions, effective graph, and digest.

### Source disappearance

Once materialized, a Workflow Run continues independently of whether its source record
still matches the provider query. Source reconciliation cannot silently remove
or reset lifecycle state.

### Invalid agent completion

If the agent finishes without `complete_state`, the state run remains
incomplete and is handled according to retry guardrails. The runtime records an
explicit error rather than guessing a transition.

## Security and governance

- Lifecycle source reads use service or delegated repository authorization.
- Publication verifies that the registering principal may access the source.
- Paths are normalized and constrained to the lifecycle source directory.
- User content cannot replace a profile-owned state unless policy explicitly
  allows it.
- Runtime tools derive the Workflow Run identity from the session association, not tool
  arguments supplied by the agent.
- Transition targets come from the pinned effective graph.
- All state changes are audited in the append-only Workflow Run journal.
- State-to-state context uses concise journal summaries and source-session
  references; it does not copy secrets or entire session transcripts into
  every journal entry.
- Attention reads are scoped to the blocking principal or an administrator.
- Notification destinations are stored as protected references rather than
  embedding webhook secrets in workflow definitions.
- Point reads retain existing Workflow Generator ownership and administrator checks.
- Secrets and source credentials are not stored in lifecycle source metadata.

## Example lifecycle

The initial demonstration uses a user-authored diagnostic fragment:

```text
WorkDetailsGathered <-> Diagnosed -> FixProposed
```

`WorkDetailsGathered` invokes durable `ask_user` before allowing the transition
to `Diagnosed`. The Workflow Run stays in `WorkDetailsGathered` while blocked. After the
answer, the session resumes, records a transition summary, and completes the
state.

`Diagnosed` produces the demonstration result and hands off to a
platform-owned profile:

```text
FixProposed -> AutomatedCodeReviewApproved -> Validated -> PRPublished
    -> HumanCodeReviewApproved -> Committed
     |
     +-- significant findings --> Diagnosed
```

Platform automation starts the configured code-review agent for `FixProposed`.
Significant findings return the Workflow Run to user-owned `Diagnosed`; otherwise the
state advances only when the latest review has no blocking findings. The
deterministic demonstration represents this review with a mock external
operation rather than launching a real review.

`AutomatedCodeReviewApproved` submits the reviewed commit to the Private
Validation Service exactly once through the external-operation interface. The
catalog records the provider correlation and generated signal key. Only the
matching completion signal thaws that state run, and the transition to
`Validated` is rejected until successful validation evidence is durable.

`Validated` prepares the change, pushes its branch, and publishes the pull
request before transitioning to `PRPublished`. The deterministic demonstration
uses a fictional URL and mock publication evidence rather than creating a real
pull request.

`PRPublished` uses an observed-condition wait for all required reviewers and
policies to approve the current source commit. It then enters
`HumanCodeReviewApproved`, which uses a separate observed-condition wait for an
authorized person to complete the pull request. Approval alone must never
complete it automatically. `Committed` is the terminal state and preserves the
pull-request and merge evidence.

The demonstration proves:

- Repository-authored Markdown publication.
- Branch-to-commit pinning.
- Exactly-once Workflow Run materialization.
- Worker-executed state runs.
- Durable response and observed-condition waits with cross-worker resumption.
- Infrastructure-generated external-operation identity and retryable signal delivery.
- Evidence-gated transitions that reject prose-only validation.
- Human-attention notification and dashboard discovery.
- Atomic, constrained transitions.
- User-to-platform lifecycle handoff.
- Terminal Workflow Run completion.

### Running the multi-Workflow Run demo

With the portal backend, Workflow Generator controller, and a matching worker already
running, the standalone runner acts only as a portal user:

```powershell
python scripts\workflow-generator-lifecycle-demo.py `
  --repository-path C:\src\<lifecycle-repository> `
  --user-branch <user-lifecycle-branch> `
  --user-base-path <user-lifecycle-directory> `
  --platform-branch <platform-lifecycle-branch> `
  --platform-base-path <platform-lifecycle-directory> `
  --full-run `
  --response-wait-seconds 2 `
  --operation-delay-seconds 1 `
  <work-item-id> [<work-item-id> ...]
```

It canonicalizes legacy HTTPS or SSH Azure DevOps remotes, resolves both
lifecycle branches to immutable commits, registers the Workflow Generator through
the portal API, and waits until every Workflow Run reaches the durable
`WorkDetailsGathered` response wait. It does not reset databases, build
components, launch services, control the browser, or stop backend processes.
Use `--portal-url` or `PILOTSWARM_PORTAL_URL` when the portal is not available
at `http://localhost:4311`.

During `--full-run`, `--response-wait-seconds` controls how long each Workflow Run
remains at its initial `ask_user` gate before the runner answers it. Workflow Runs are
timed and answered independently, so one Workflow Run does not remain parked merely
because another has not reached the gate. `--operation-delay-seconds` controls
the `delayMs` requested from each deterministic mock automated-review, validation,
pull-request publication, human-review, and PR-completion operation. Its
accepted range is 0 through 300 seconds. The previous
`--human-wait-seconds` and `--system-wait-seconds` names remain accepted as
hidden compatibility aliases.

#### Real Azure DevOps provider mode (observe-existing-PR)

`--provider-mode azure_devops` (or `WORKFLOW_GENERATOR_E2E_PROVIDER_MODE=azure_devops`)
swaps the two human-facing gates from the deterministic mock to the production
Azure DevOps observers: the transition into `HumanCodeReviewApproved` is gated
by a real `pull_request_approval` observation and the transition into
`Committed` by a real `pull_request_completion` observation. The automated
review, validation, and pull-request-publication gates stay deterministic mocks —
lifecycle-driven publication of a real branch and pull request is out of scope
for this harness.

Because both observers are strictly read-only, real-provider confidence is
obtained by attaching the demo to a genuine, externally-managed pull request
rather than by publishing a throwaway PR. Supply the pull request with
`--observe-pull-request-url` (its organization, project, repository, and ID seed
the durable target) plus `--observe-source-commit` (the 40-character head the PR
must still point at). Individual fields can be overridden or supplied directly
with `--observe-organization`, `--observe-project`, `--observe-repository-id`,
and `--observe-pull-request-id`; matching `WORKFLOW_GENERATOR_E2E_OBSERVE_*` variables are
also honored. The runner never publishes, approves, completes, abandons, or
otherwise mutates the observed pull request.

The observed target's organization, project, and repository must match the Workflow Run
`affinities.repo` entry in the server-owned `WORKFLOW_GENERATOR_ADO_REPOSITORY_BINDINGS`
array so the observers authorize the target before using any credential. A
convenient live proof points at a recently-completed pull request already
signed off by all required reviewers (for example a service-repository pull request), so
a single `--full-run` observes real reviewer, policy, and completion state —
including the real merge commit — with no mutation.

The Workflow Run wait scheduler runs with the Workflow Generator by default. Set
`WORKFLOW_GENERATOR_WAIT_SCHEDULER_ENABLED=false` to disable it. Optional tuning variables
are `WORKFLOW_GENERATOR_WAIT_POLL_INTERVAL_MS`, `WORKFLOW_GENERATOR_WAIT_DEFAULT_CHECK_INTERVAL_MS`,
`WORKFLOW_GENERATOR_WAIT_RETRY_DELAY_MS`, `WORKFLOW_GENERATOR_WAIT_MAX_RETRY_DELAY_MS`,
`WORKFLOW_GENERATOR_WAIT_CLAIM_LIMIT`, and `WORKFLOW_GENERATOR_WAIT_LEASE_SECONDS`.
Set `WORKFLOW_GENERATOR_MOCK_EXTERNAL_OPERATIONS=true` to register the deterministic mock
observer used by lifecycle demos.
The Azure DevOps pull-request approval observer is registered whenever the
Workflow Run wait scheduler is enabled. It uses `WORKFLOW_GENERATOR_ADO_TOKEN` as an explicit bearer
token, `WORKFLOW_GENERATOR_ADO_PAT` or `AZURE_DEVOPS_EXT_PAT` as a PAT, and otherwise
`DefaultAzureCredential`. Its `pull_request_approval` target requires
`organization`, `project`, `repositoryId`, `pullRequestId`, and the exact
`expectedSourceCommit`. The Workflow Run definition must also have an `affinities.repo`
value bound to the same organization, project, and repository ID in the
server-owned `WORKFLOW_GENERATOR_ADO_REPOSITORY_BINDINGS` JSON array. The default durable
operation key includes a hash of that canonical repository, pull request, and
expected commit, so a new PR head creates a distinct wait. A
`pull_request_completion` observer is registered alongside it with the same
credential precedence, target shape, and repository authorization; its default
operation key uses a distinct prefix so completion waits never collide with the
approval wait for the same PR.

## Implementation sequence

1. Implement exact current-state Markdown loading from separate pinned user and
   platform sources.
2. Implement the lifecycle policy model and versioned profile registry.
3. Extend definition publication to resolve and pin lifecycle source, profile,
   policy, and entry-state metadata.
4. Add Workflow Run current-state fields, state runs, transitions, and catalog
   operations.
5. Extend workers to lease state runs and execute the exact Markdown matching
   the Workflow Run's durable current state.
6. Add semantic graph validation, inject `complete_state`, and connect it to
   atomic catalog transitions.
7. Add durable external-wait projection and adapters for asynchronous system
   work.
8. Project existing `ask_user` suspension onto Workflow Run and state-run status.
9. Add attention requests, notification outbox delivery, and a blocked-work
   dashboard.
10. Add lifecycle registration, validation preview, and Workflow Run history to the
   portal.
11. Run the end-to-end demonstration and add integration coverage for restart,
   replay, stale revision, and ownership-boundary behavior.

These slices should remain independently deployable. State loading can land
before workers execute state machines, and worker support can land before the
portal exposes the full lifecycle visualization.
