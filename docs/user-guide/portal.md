# PilotSwarm User Guide — Browser Portal

This guide walks through the browser portal scenario by scenario. Same
sessions, same runtime as the [terminal UI](./tui.md) — different surface.

The portal lives at `http://localhost:3001` by default. You can switch
between the TUI and the portal at any time; they don't conflict.

## Prerequisites

Either:

- **Docker quickstart** (easiest): `docker run -d -p 127.0.0.1:3001:3001 -p 127.0.0.1:2222:2222 -e GITHUB_TOKEN -v pilotswarm-data:/data --name pilotswarm-starter affandar/pilotswarm-starter:latest`. Then open `http://localhost:3001`.
- **From source**: `npm install && npm run build`, set up `.env` (see [getting-started.md](../quickstart/local.md)), then `npm run portal:start` (or `./scripts/portal-start.sh`). Open `http://localhost:3001`.

For a pinned Docker quickstart, replace `latest` with `0.4.0`.

For deployments with Entra ID auth enabled, you'll see a sign-in flow first.
With identity-aware proxy auth, the proxy completes sign-in before the portal
loads. For local development, sign-in is normally bypassed.

For several sessions at once, open the
[Master of Agents workspace](./master-of-agents.md). It saves up to five personal
chat/canvas dashboards. Each panel has its own message box by default.
**Dashboard options → Message boxes** can restore one shared box below all panes. Desktop
tabs collapse into a picker when the header gets narrow.
On phones it presents one panel at a time with a geometry-preserving minimap
and swipe navigation.

Tool calls and messages between agents appear in chat as collapsed, single-line
previews. Long first lines end with an ellipsis; click or tap to expand the
arguments, output, or message. A call updates in place as results arrive, and
keeps its expansion state. The same previews work in ordinary chat and MoA.
The Activity pane still contains the full event stream, including diagnostic
notices for turns that finish without a reply.

Native task activity appears inside its owning **Explore** or **Task** card.
Expand a tool call there to inspect its arguments and result. Running and failed
tasks open automatically; successful tasks collapse unless you have inspected
them. Each task keeps its own activity when several tasks run at once, including
after reloading the conversation.

Use **Find a session…** in the Sessions pane or workspace session picker to
filter the catalog. Text appears immediately, and results update after a short
typing pause. Clearing the field restores the full list.

On mobile, tap the search icon inside a visible session list to open a search
overlay above the chat. Search and sort controls stay at the top while results
scroll through the remaining space, including above the keyboard. This works
from the partial list, full list, and MoA session picker. Selecting a session
closes search and opens that session; in the MoA picker it selects the session
for the panel. Close or Escape returns without switching chats and clears the
search filter.

The icon buttons beside search (above it on narrow panes) offer **Recently used**, **Recently updated**,
and **Saved order** on desktop, mobile, and in the session picker. The clock, activity pulse, and bookmark icons show these modes; the selected icon is highlighted. Hover or long-press for a label. Recently used tracks
sessions you open, focus in MoA, or message. Recently updated uses session update
times. Choosing a mode applies that order once. Live activity keeps the positions
stable; press the adjacent **Refresh session order** button to fetch and sort again.
Folders, pinned sections, and child sessions keep their structure. **Saved** restores
your manual arrangement and enables drag ordering. The selected mode and usage
history are saved in your profile; new sessions append until you refresh.
System sessions remain at the top. Recency sorts sessions within each folder; it
does not pull them out into the main list. Folder positions use the folder
record’s own update time, not the newest activity of its members. Expanding and
collapsing a folder preserves the current order.

## Layout overview

When the portal opens you see three panes:

- **Sessions** — left column, session tree (or list on mobile).
- **Chat + Activity** — center, the conversation and a live event stream
  beside it.
- **Inspector** — right column, with tabs along the top.

The layout is responsive — on narrow screens it collapses panes into a
stack you swipe between, with a top bar for navigation.

# Part 1 — Beginner

## Scenario 1: Say hello

**What you're trying to do:** prove the system works end to end with a
single short conversation.

**Setup:** Portal open at `http://localhost:3001`.

**Steps:**

1. Click **New** (top-left of the Sessions pane).
2. The agent picker dialog opens. Pick the default agent (or just hit
   Enter).
3. The session appears in the list and is automatically selected.
4. Click into the prompt box at the bottom. Type
   `What's the weather in NYC?` and click **Send** (or press `Enter`).
5. Watch the message badge next to your text:
   - `○` — your client has the message but the runtime hasn't ack'd yet
   - `✓` — durably queued
   - `✓✓` — the agent's seen it
6. The session badge transitions: `pending` → `running`. The chat
   streams the response. The activity panel beside chat shows tool
   calls / events as they fire.
7. When the agent finishes, the badge returns to `idle`.

**What just happened:**

Your message went into a durable Postgres queue. A worker picked it up,
spawned a Copilot SDK session, ran one LLM turn, and published the
response back. The portal polls the orchestration's custom-status and
the catalog event log; you saw both update live.

**Try this next:**

- The inspector tabs along the top right: `sequence`, `logs`, `nodes`,
  `history`, `files`, `stats`. Click each to see a different view of
  the same session.
- Right-click (or use the session row's menu, depending on your
  browser/version) on the session to rename it.

---

## Scenario 2: Watch a long task suspend and resume

**What you're trying to do:** see the durability story with your own
eyes, not believe the marketing.

**Setup:** From Scenario 1.

**Steps:**

1. New session (default agent). Send:

       Wait for 60 seconds, then tell me what time it is.

2. The agent calls `wait(60)`. Within a turn or two, the session badge
   changes to `waiting · 58s · "user requested wait"` (countdown is
   live).
3. Click the **sequence** inspector tab. Find the `wait_started` event
   and the `dehydrate` activity. The session is now archived to blob
   storage.
4. **Optional durability proof:** in another tab/terminal, kill the
   worker process (or `docker stop pilotswarm-starter`). The portal
   will show the workers as offline; the session row remains in
   `waiting`.
5. Restart workers. Wait until the timer fires. The session resumes
   and emits its final response. Badge returns to `idle`.

**What just happened:**

The agent's `wait(60)` tool call became a durable Postgres timer. The
in-memory session was archived to blob (dehydrated). The worker
process was free to do other work — or, in step 4, exit entirely. When
the timer fired, any worker rehydrated and resumed. The model didn't
notice the worker change; from its perspective there was a 60-second
pause between two messages.

**Try this next:**

- Same scenario but `Wait for 5 minutes`. Notice that for short waits
  (under ~30 seconds) the session **doesn't** dehydrate — it stays
  warm to avoid the round-trip cost.
- Try `cron`: ask the agent `Tell me the time every 30 seconds, three
  times`. The session uses `cron(30)` and re-arms itself.
- **Stop a turn mid-flight**: while the agent is working, a red **■**
  button appears next to Send. Click it — the in-flight turn aborts,
  the transcript records `Turn stopped by user.`, and the session
  returns to `idle` ready for your next prompt. This stops only the
  current turn: the session (and any cron schedule it has) stays
  alive, unlike **Terminate**, which ends the session.

---

## Scenario 3: Two things at once

**What you're trying to do:** run sessions in parallel and move
between them quickly.

**Setup:** From Scenario 1 or 2.

**Steps:**

1. **New** twice, send a different prompt to each.
2. Click between sessions in the list to switch focus. The chat,
   activity, and inspector all re-render for the active session.
3. Drag the divider between Sessions and Chat to resize the split.
4. **Pin** a session via its row menu (or the pin icon in the header
   when selected). Pinned groups sort above pinned single sessions; pinned
   single sessions sort above unpinned groups.
5. **Multi-select** — there's typically a checkbox toggle or a "select
   mode" button at the top of the Sessions pane. Activate it, click
   sessions to select, then use the toolbar action **Cancel selected**.
   System sessions are skipped automatically.
6. **Group** one or more non-system sessions from the Sessions pane
   header. Selecting the `🗂` row opens a read-only details view with
   metric and member tables; it is not a chat transcript. Groups are
   **your private organization** — like mail folders. Only you see your
   groups, any session you can read (including ones shared with you) can
   be placed in them, and grouping or ungrouping never changes what
   anyone else sees.

**What just happened:**

Each session is its own durable orchestration running in parallel.
Different workers can be handling different sessions. The portal's
Sessions pane is a live view backed by the catalog — when state
changes anywhere, your browser reflects it within a poll cycle.

**Try this next:**

- Use the **owner filter** in the Sessions pane header to narrow to
  just your sessions when there are many users on the same Postgres.
  It includes a **"Shared with me"** bucket that shows sessions other
  users have shared with you.
- To share a session with teammates (or open it deployment-wide), open
  the **Share** button in the Sessions pane toolbar — the "Share &
  settings" modal combines rename, **Copy link**, visibility (private /
  shared read / shared write), and per-person grants. The toolbar also
  has a standalone **Copy link** button. A link is a *locator, not a
  grant*: if the session is private with no grants, the copy
  confirmation warns "Only people with access can open this link." Who
  can see and act on what is covered in
  [Access, sharing & security](./security-and-sharing.md).
- Deep links are explicit about failure: opening `?session=<id>` for a
  session that doesn't exist **or isn't shared with you** shows a clear
  "This session was not found or has not been shared with you" error
  (the two cases are deliberately indistinguishable) instead of silently
  falling back to another session; transient network failures show a
  retryable error.
  If the linked session is outside your current filters, it is shown
  anyway with a "Showing linked session outside your current filters"
  notice until you navigate or change filters.
- A canvas has its own **Share canvas** dialog with two audiences. Its
  **Session access** tab produces a normal deep link — the recipient signs
  in and the usual visibility rules decide whether they get in — and offers
  a **Hide page chrome** checkbox (off by default). Checked, the link gains
  `show_chrome=false` and lands on the canvas alone: no portal header, no
  workspace around it, just a thin strip naming the deployment and a
  deliberately faint **Show chrome** button that brings the header back
  without reloading. This is presentation only. It changes nothing about
  access — a parameter in a URL is not a permission, and the recipient can
  simply delete it — so who may edit inside the app is still decided by
  "Who can edit inside this app" in the same dialog. The **Anyone with
  link** tab is the different thing: a token that needs no sign-in at all
  and is always read-only.

# Part 2 — Intermediate

## Scenario 4: Bulk-cleanup messy sessions

**What you're trying to do:** 12 sessions left from yesterday's
experiments. Keep three, kill nine.

**Setup:** Lots of stale sessions in the list.

**Steps:**

1. Open the **owner filter** to narrow to yours.
2. For sessions you want to keep: rename them via the row menu, then
   pin them.
3. Enter **multi-select mode** (the checkbox toggle / "select" button).
4. Click each session you want to remove (skip the keepers).
5. Use the toolbar action **Cancel selected** — confirm.
6. Exit multi-select, refresh.

**Three flavors of close:**

| Action | Effect |
|---|---|
| **Cancel** | Graceful shutdown. Cascades to sub-agents. CMS state → `cancelled`. |
| **Done** | Graceful completion. Same cascade. CMS state → `completed`. The "I finished, archive this" verb. |
| **Delete** | Hard delete. Removes from CMS along with all descendants. Use sparingly. |

**What just happened:**

Each Cancel enqueued a `cancel` command into that session's durable
queue. The orchestration drained the command, cascaded `cancel` to any
running sub-agents, waited up to 60 seconds for them to drain
gracefully, then updated CMS state. Delete is the same flow plus a CMS
row removal at the end.

**Try this next:**

- Watch a sub-agent-rich session in the **sequence** tab during a
  cancel. You'll see the cascade — child cancellations poll-acked one
  by one before the parent finishes.

---

## Scenario 5: Hand the agent a file, get a file back

**What you're trying to do:** feed the agent a CSV of error logs, ask
it to summarize, get a markdown report you can download.

**Setup:** A new session, default agent.

**Steps:**

1. In the prompt box, click the **attach** icon (paperclip or similar).
   Browse to your local file. Or drag-and-drop it onto the prompt box.
2. The file uploads immediately. An `artifact://...` reference is
   inserted into the prompt at the cursor.
3. Type around it, e.g.:

       Look at artifact://errors.csv. Summarize the top 5 root causes
       as a markdown report. Use write_artifact so I
       can download it.

4. Send. The agent reads your CSV, runs analysis, calls
   `write_artifact` and replies with the `artifact://` link.
5. Click the **files** inspector tab. The new artifact appears.
6. With the file selected:
   - Inline preview renders for markdown / images / PDFs.
   - The download icon downloads the file via the browser.
   - Fullscreen toggle expands the preview.
   - Delete (with confirm) removes the artifact.
7. Filter the file list to show **selected session only** vs **all
   sessions**.

**Linked-item view:**

8. Inside the chat pane there's typically a **Linked items** affordance
   (icon in the message header or a sidebar toggle). It collects every
   `artifact://` reference and URL from the current chat into a single
   navigable list.

**What just happened:**

Your upload went into the storage-backed artifact store (filesystem in
local mode, blob in production). The agent received an `artifact://`
reference in the prompt, called the same artifact API on its end to
read it, and wrote a new artifact back. Artifacts persist across
worker pods because they're not on local disk.

---

## Scenario 6: Drilling into what an agent did

**What you're trying to do:** an agent took 30 seconds for a trivial
turn and you want to know why.

**Setup:** A session with at least one completed turn.

**Steps — visit every inspector tab:**

1. **`sequence`** — every yield in the orchestration: prompt received,
   runTurn started, tool calls, wait timers, dehydrate/hydrate events,
   continueAsNew. Read top-to-bottom to reconstruct the turn. The
   portal renders this as a swim-lane diagram.
2. **`logs`** — raw worker logs. The portal usually has a tail toggle
   and a filter input (severity + keyword).
3. **`nodes`** — which worker pod handled which turn. In a multi-worker
   deployment this shows session relocation across nodes during
   dehydrate / rehydrate.
4. **`history`** — the durable event log from the catalog. Every
   `user.message`, `assistant.message`, `session.wait_started`,
   `session.command_received`, etc.
5. **`files`** — covered in Scenario 5.
6. **`stats`** — token usage, turn durations, context-window
   utilization. Inside stats, switch between **session** (this
   session), **fleet** (whole deployment), and **users** (per-owner
   aggregates).

**Diagnosing the slow turn:**

7. Open **sequence**. Find the gap. Is it within one event (slow LLM
   call)? Between activities (slow dehydrate or CMS write)? Around a
   `wait_started` (the agent *meant* to be slow)?
8. Cross-reference with **logs** — tail mode + filter on `warn` or
   `error`.
9. Check **nodes** — was it one specific worker (probably that pod's
   problem) or all workers (probably the model or the database)?

**What just happened:**

Each tab is rendered from a different data source: `sequence` from
duroxide history, `logs` from worker stdout streamed through the
portal, `nodes` from `session_events` joined with worker IDs,
`history` from the CMS event log, `files` from artifact storage,
`stats` from a metrics summary table the worker writes after each
turn. The portal is read-only for these views.

---

# Part 3 — Advanced

## Scenario 7: Sub-agents and the spawn tree

**What you're trying to do:** dispatch parallel sub-agents to
investigate different angles of the same question.

**Setup:** Best with the [DevOps Command Center
sample](../../examples/devops-command-center/README.md) plugin loaded.

**Steps:**

1. Click **New** and pick the `investigator` agent (or any
   agent allowed to spawn children).
2. Send a prompt that invites parallel work, e.g.:

       Investigate the latency spike at 14:32. Spawn separate
       sub-agents to check metrics, scan logs, and look at recent
       deploys. Then summarize.

3. Watch the Sessions pane. Child sessions appear nested under the
   parent. Expand the parent to see them.
4. The parent's chat pane shows incoming child-update digests — short
   summaries of each child's status, batched every ~30 seconds.
5. Children stay alive after their final reply. Their badges go to
   `idle`. The parent decides when they're really done by calling
   `complete_agent`.

**The `wait_for_agents` tool:**

6. Send a follow-up that explicitly blocks the parent on the children:

       Spawn three more sub-agents with different hypotheses. Use
       wait_for_agents to block until all three respond, then merge
       their answers.

7. The parent's badge goes to `waiting` with reason "waiting for N
   agents". The parent rehydrates as soon as the last child finishes.

**What just happened:**

`spawn_agent` is a tool the LLM calls. The orchestration creates a new
child session via the SDK, sends it the bootstrap prompt, and tracks
it in the parent's `subAgents` table. Children communicate back via
durable messages on the parent's queue, batched into a 30-second
digest before the parent processes them. Children staying alive after
final reply makes follow-up `message_agent` conversations possible.

For a child using a different model, first call `list_available_models`.
Its catalog lists each model's supported reasoning strengths and context
tiers, with defaults and per-tier token capacities when declared. The MCP
`list_models` tool exposes these as `supported_reasoning_efforts`,
`default_reasoning_effort`, `supported_context_tiers`, `default_context_tier`,
and `context_window_sizes`. An omitted capacity means it is not declared.
Pass the exact qualified model name
and supported `reasoning_effort` and `context_tier` values to `spawn_agent`.
For example, `context_tier: "default"` overrides a parent's long context
when the child model only supports default context. The other context
option is `"long_context"`; omitting the option preserves inheritance.
An explicit override affects only the child, not the parent or provider defaults.


---

## Scenario 8: A delayed multi-step workflow (the durability flagship)

**What you're trying to do:** a real long-haul workflow that survives
across worker restarts, scales to zero between turns, and produces an
artifact at the end.

**Setup:** DevOps Command Center sample plugin. Watchdog and Janitor
auto-start.

**Steps:**

1. Find Watchdog in the sessions list (marked as a system session). It
   has a cron schedule polling service health every few minutes.
2. Create a Reporter session. Send:

       Generate a daily incident report at midnight UTC. Aggregate
       data from Watchdog's findings over the last 24h. Write it
       as a markdown artifact and export it for download.

3. The Reporter calls `cron(86400, "midnight UTC")`. It exits its
   turn — badge `waiting · ~5h to next fire`.
4. **Now leave it.** Close the browser. Shut down the laptop if you
   want. Postgres and the workers keep running.
5. Come back tomorrow. Open the portal.
6. The Reporter is still in the list. Click it.
7. Chat history shows: at midnight UTC the cron fired, the agent ran a
   turn, generated the report, wrote and exported it. Session is back
   to `waiting` for the next midnight.
8. **files** tab → today's report → download.
9. If the Reporter asked a question via `ask_user`, the badge would
   read `input_required` instead of `waiting`. Send your answer; the
   agent resumes from your reply.

**Combining everything:**

A longer chain: Investigator finds a deploy correlation in metrics,
spawns Deployer with `ask_user` for human approval, deploys after you
approve, Reporter aggregates the result. Single workflow, multiple
agents, multiple workers, durable across all of them. **This is what
PilotSwarm is for.**

**What just happened:**

Each `wait`/`cron` call moved the session into durable storage. While
the Reporter was sleeping until midnight, it was a row in Postgres
and a blob — zero compute. When midnight hit, the runtime scheduled
the next turn against any available worker. That worker rehydrated,
ran one turn, dehydrated again. The "always-on Reporter" is actually
intermittent execution spread across days — the LLM sees a coherent
conversation.

**Try this next:**

- Run multiple long-haul sessions simultaneously. Dehydrated sessions
  cost ~zero. The author has run 1000+ on a 2-node cluster.

---

## Scenario 9: Portal ↔ TUI — same sessions, different surface

**What you're trying to do:** start work in the portal, continue in
the TUI. Or vice versa.

**Setup:** Portal at `http://localhost:3001`, TUI via
`ssh -p 2222 pilotswarm@localhost` or `./run.sh local --db`.

**Steps:**

1. Start a session in the portal as in Scenario 1. Send a couple of
   messages.
2. Open the TUI.
3. The same sessions list is in the TUI's left pane.
4. Select the session you started in the portal. The chat history is
   there.
5. Send a message from the TUI. Tab back to the portal — the message
   shows up within a poll cycle.
6. The state badges, message states (`○`/`✓`/`✓✓`), inspector tabs,
   files all match.

**Model providers and defaults (Admin Console):**

7. Open **Admin → Model Providers**.
8. **My Providers** holds your credentials and default. **Shared Providers**
   holds cluster/system routing and system-agent overrides (administrators).
9. Use **Update Key** on a personal provider when its credential expires. The
   provider name, defaults, session routing, and usage history stay intact.
10. **Providers & Budgets** shows user spend by provider and model. Admins also
   see system spend as a separate, uncapped breakdown.

**What just happened:**

Both surfaces talk to the same Postgres + duroxide pair. They both
poll the catalog and the orchestration's custom-status. Either can
drive a session, both reflect changes within a poll cycle. The
portal supports mobile layouts and richer inline previews; the TUI is
faster for keyboard-heavy work and runs over SSH.

**Try this next:**

- Open the portal on your phone and check on long-running sessions
  while away from your desk.

---

## Scenario 10: Make it your own

**What you're trying to do:** customize the portal — different agents,
different tools, different branding.

This crosses into developer territory; for the full walkthrough see
[Building SDK Apps](../developer/building/sdk-apps.md) and
[Building CLI Apps](../developer/building/cli-apps.md).

**The plugin model:**

1. Create a `plugin/` directory with subfolders for `agents/`,
   `skills/`, and an optional `worker-module.js` for custom tools.
2. Define an agent in `agents/your-agent.agent.md` with YAML
   frontmatter (name, title, system message, allowed tools, etc.) and
   a body that becomes the system prompt.
3. Register custom tools in `worker-module.js` via `defineTool(...)`.
4. Set `PLUGIN_DIRS=./plugin` in your `.env` and restart workers
   (today; hot reload is on the roadmap).
5. Open the portal — your agent appears in the **New** session picker.

**What you can customize:**

- **Agents** — system prompts, allowed tools, default model, behavior
  hints
- **Tools** — anything you can write in JS/TS, called via
  `defineTool()`
- **Skills** — markdown-based playbooks the agent loads on demand
- **MCP servers** — connect external tool surfaces
- **UI splash + theme + branding** — the portal supports custom logos
  and themes when run as your app's front-end
- **Session policy** — restrict which agents users can create

The [DevOps Command Center sample](../../examples/devops-command-center/README.md)
is a complete reference plugin. Copy it, swap out the tools, ship it
as your app's portal.

# Reference

## Common navigation

| Action | How |
|---|---|
| New session | **New** button (top-left) |
| Switch session | Click in list |
| Previous / next view (desktop) | **Back / Forward** arrows between Filter and Canvas, or compact arrows beside the exit/restore control when chrome is hidden; `Alt+-` / `Alt++` on Windows, `Option+-` / `Option++` on macOS. Works in the composer and preserves drafts; other text fields and open dialogs retain their keys. |
| Send prompt | Type, press `Enter` (Shift+Enter for newline) |
| Stop the current turn | Red `■` button next to Send while the session is running; session stays alive and returns to idle |
| Attach file | Paperclip icon, or drag-and-drop |
| Cycle inspector tabs | Click the tab; on mobile, swipe |
| Rename session | Row menu → Rename |
| Pin session | Row menu → Pin |
| Group sessions | Select one or more non-system sessions, then click **Group** / **Group (n)** in the Sessions pane header (groups are private to you; any session you can read can be placed) |
| Copy session link | **Copy link** button in the Sessions pane toolbar (also inside Share & settings). The link locates the session; it does not grant access |
| Share / manage access | **Share** button in the Sessions pane toolbar → Share & settings (rename, copy link, visibility, per-person grants) |
| Cancel session | Row menu → Cancel |
| Multi-select | Toolbar toggle, click rows, then **Cancel selected** |
| Filter sessions | Filter input in Sessions pane header |
| Toggle session summary | Click **Summary** / **Chat** in the top toolbar; Summary is read-only and hides the prompt box |
| Open Admin Console | Admin / settings menu → Model Providers |

Many of the TUI keys (`j`/`k` to navigate, `r` to refresh,
etc.) work inside the portal too when no input is focused.

Desktop view history remembers the last ten deliberate destinations in this browser tab:
sessions, MoA dashboards, canvases, artifact previews, Settings and Budget. Back and Forward
restore the view; opening a new destination after Back replaces the forward branch.
Background refreshes and agent activity do not create entries. History stores only view
references, scoped to the signed-in account and site, and survives a tab refresh. The controls
and shortcuts are unavailable on mobile layouts. Browser zoom shortcuts remain unchanged.

## Mobile

The portal is responsive. On small viewports:

- Sessions / Chat / Inspector collapse into a stack you swipe through.
- The top bar exposes session navigation, the pin / multi-select
  toolbar, and the Admin / settings menu.
- Inline file previews adapt; markdown wraps narrower, images shrink to
  fit.

The runtime is unchanged on mobile — long-running agents work the same
way; you just have a smaller window into them.

## Troubleshooting

**Session is stuck in `running` and nothing's happening.**
Check the **logs** inspector tab. Common causes: LLM provider rate
limit, an invalid provider credential (use **Update Key** in Admin Console →
Model Providers),
worker disconnected.

**Session won't appear in the list.**
Refresh. Check the owner filter — it may be filtered out.

**Sub-agent finished but parent didn't notice.**
The parent batches child updates for ~30 seconds before dispatching.
Wait. If still nothing, check the parent's **sequence** tab for
`pendingChildDigest` events.

**Worker died and now everything is stuck.**
Restart workers. Sessions in `waiting` resume automatically when their
timer fires; sessions mid-turn replay from the last yield.

**The portal is showing stale data.**
Hit your browser's reload. The portal state is recoverable from the
catalog and the runtime — there's no client-side state worth losing.

For deeper issues see [Architecture](../architecture/system.md) and
[Orchestration Design](../architecture/orchestration/design.md).

### Compact panes and history scrolling

In MoA, narrow panes place activity status beneath the title so the action buttons stay together. Per-chat message boxes appear only in focused chat panes; canvases use the full pane height. Chat drafts survive switching between panes, and the shared message-box option remains available.

At the top of loaded chat history, scrolling requests older messages. The visible message stays anchored while the request is pending; when the page arrives, the same gesture advances by only one scroll row (16 pixels). Continued wheel or touch momentum cannot sweep through the newly loaded page. A fresh gesture resumes ordinary scrolling.
