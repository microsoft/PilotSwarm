# PilotSwarm TUI — Keybinding Reference

This document matches the current terminal UI behavior in [`run.sh`](../../run.sh) and [`packages/app/tui/src/app.js`](../../packages/app/tui/src/app.js).

## Global Navigation

These keys work whenever focus is not in the prompt editor.

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `q` | Quit |
| `Ctrl+C` | Quit immediately |
| `Esc` | Return focus to Sessions |
| `Tab` / `Shift+Tab` | Cycle focus between panes |
| `h` / `l` | Move focus left / right |
| `p` | Focus the prompt editor |
| `n` | Create a generic session immediately when generic sessions are allowed; otherwise open the model-first creation flow when models are available, or the agent picker |
| `Shift+N` | Pick model/reasoning first, then choose generic or a named agent |
| `r` | Refresh sessions and visible data |
| `a` | Open the linked-item picker for current chat artifacts and visible URLs |
| `Shift+A` | Open or close the Admin Console (model providers, defaults, agent packages, and workers) |
| `m` | Cycle inspector tab (`sequence` → `logs` → `nodes` → `history` → `files` → `stats`) |
| `[` / `]` | Resize the main split |
| `c` | Cancel the selected session |
| `d` | Mark the selected session done |

| `+` / `=` | Expand the selected parent session |
| `-` | Collapse the selected session |
| `t` | Rename the selected session |
| `P` | Pin or unpin the selected top-level session (system and child sessions cannot be pinned) |
| `v` | Cycle the selected owned session tree through `private` → `shared_read` → `shared_write` |
| `Shift+S` | Open targeted user sharing for the selected owned session tree |
| `V` | Toggle multi-select mode (seeds the selection with the active session) |
| `Space` | (in multi-select mode) Toggle selection on the active row |

## Stats Inspector

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|

## Files Inspector

### File list

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `j` / `k` | Move file selection |

## Prompt Editor

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Enter` | Send the current message, or queue it behind pending prompts for busy/system sessions |
| `Option+Enter` / `Alt+Enter` | Insert a newline |
| `Ctrl+J` | Insert a newline |
| `Ctrl+A` | Attach a local file to the draft |
| `Esc` | Leave prompt mode and return to Sessions, or cancel the selected queued pending prompt |
| `←` / `→` | Move cursor by character |
| `↑` / `↓` | Move cursor vertically across prompt lines, then enter/leave queued pending-prompt editing at the top/bottom boundary |
| `Option+←` / `Option+→` | Move cursor by word |
| `Backspace` / `Delete` | Delete one character |
| `Option+Backspace` / `Option+Delete` | Delete the previous word |

Notes:

- The prompt grows to a three-line viewport and then scrolls as you keep adding lines.
- Attached files are uploaded immediately and inserted into the outgoing prompt as `artifact://...` references when the message is sent.
- Every send first lands in a per-session local outbox, then transitions through three durability states shown next to each user message in chat:
  - `○` pending — client-only, not yet acknowledged by the runtime
  - `✓` queued — durably enqueued to the orchestration, waiting to be processed
  - `✓✓` sent — persisted as a `user.message` in the durable transcript; the LLM has it
- Multiple synchronous sends coalesce into a single durable enqueue. Pressing `Enter` on an empty draft forces an immediate dispatch of any still-pending items.
- Pressing `↑` at the top prompt boundary recalls the most recent pending item for editing. Pressing `↓` at the bottom boundary moves forward through pending items and eventually returns to the live draft.
- `Esc` while editing a recalled pending item cancels that item before it becomes durable.

## Modals and Dialogs

| Context | Keys |
|---------|------|
| model picker | `j/k`, arrows, `Enter`, `Esc` |
| session agent picker | `j/k`, arrows, `Enter`, `Esc` |
| session owner filter | `j/k`, arrows, `Space`, `Esc` |
| linked-item picker | `j/k`, arrows, `Enter`, `Esc`, `a` |
| log/files filters | `Tab` / `Shift+Tab`, `j/k`, arrows, `Enter`, `Esc` |
| rename dialog | type text, `←/→`, `Home`, `End`, `Backspace`, `Enter`, `Esc` |
| attach-file dialog | type path, `←/→`, `Home`, `End`, `Backspace`, `Enter`, `Esc` |

## Admin Console (`Shift+A`)

The Admin Console takes over the workspace until you press `Esc` to close it. While the console is visible the normal workspace shortcuts are suppressed.

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `m` | Show My Providers |
| `M` | Show Shared Providers (administrators only) |
| `a` | Show Agent Packages |
| `w` | Show Workers (administrators only) |
| `e` | Add a personal provider |
| `U` | Update the selected personal provider's credential (input is masked) |
| `E` | Add a shared model provider (administrators only) |
| `d` | Confirm-delete the selected personal or shared provider |
| `u` | Cycle My Session Default through usable choices and automatic fallback |
| `l` | Cycle Cluster Session Default through shared providers (administrators only) |
| `s` | Cycle System Session Default for future starts (administrators only) |
| `C` / `T` / `H` | Apply the next system default and Complete / Terminate / Hard Delete & Restart inheriting system sessions |
| `Tab` | On Shared Providers, switch between providers and system-agent overrides |
| `j` / `k` | Move the selected personal provider or system agent |
| `t` | Toggle system-session use for the selected admin-owned personal provider |
| `o` | Cycle the selected system-agent override; automatic clears it to inherit |
| `r` | Refresh providers and defaults (or the active Agents/Workers section) |
| `Esc` | Close the console and return to the workspace |

While the provider-creation wizard is open the console behaves like a modal:

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| type text, `←/→`, `Home`, `End`, `Backspace` | Edit the provider name, then the credential (credential input is masked) |
| `Tab` (name step) | Cycle the catalog's provider types; personal creation starts on GitHub Copilot |
| `Enter` | Continue from name to credential, then create the provider; in update mode, replace the credential |
| `Esc` | Cancel and clear the draft |

Personal-provider system use permits PilotSwarm's system machinery to use that
credential. It never exposes the provider to another user and is not a cluster
use grant. Per-agent override changes use a durable model switch; restart the
system session separately when a fresh session is required.
