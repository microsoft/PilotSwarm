# Session Canvas

The canvas is a session's standing visual workspace: up to five named live HTML
documents that the agent draws, updates in place, presents, and reuses —
rendered in the portal beside the chat, surviving reloads, context
regeneration, and worker moves. Root and sub-agent sessions have the same
canvas tools. The workspace replaced the retired session-summary mechanism as
the at-a-glance answer to "what is this session showing me?"

This is the as-built reference. Design history lives in
[proposals/session-canvas.md](../proposals/session-canvas.md) (v1) and
[proposals/canvas-apps.md](../proposals/canvas-apps.md) (reusable apps;
phases 2–3 there are designed but unshipped).

## The spine: one artifact per slot, one event stream

A drawn canvas slot is exactly two durable facts:

1. **Bytes** — one reserved, always-pinned artifact on the session. Slot 1
   keeps the original `canvas.html` filename; slots 2–5 use `canvas2.html`
   through `canvas5.html`. Every draw replaces that slot wholesale (there is
   no document patching; in-place *data* updates ride ticks, below).
2. **A `session.canvas_updated` event** carrying `{rev, sizeBytes, note?,
   slot, name?, responseContract?, source?}`. `rev` is monotonic within the
   slot, derived from its latest events at draw time. The event is the single
   authority: bytes without an event read as "not drawn".

Ordering is bytes-then-event, awaited, inside a per-session serialized draw
chain in the session proxy — a rev is only ever advertised after both halves
exist. The bridge records the event itself; the generic event persister lists
canvas event types as already-persisted so no path can double-insert. Rev
derivation reads fail loud: a transient catalog error fails the draw rather
than reading as "no canvas" (which would mint rev 1 over a live canvas).

Clients — portal, TUI — learn revisions from the same event they'd learn
anything else from: live push and cold snapshot alike, no side channel. The
portal keeps per-session, per-slot canvas prefs (selection, last viewed
rev/dataRev, and dismissal opt-outs) merged max-wins across devices. A catalog
cache records slot names and latest revisions for efficient cold loads; the
durable event stream remains authoritative.

## Tools

All four tools accept `slot` 1–5 and default to slot 1.

### `draw_canvas`

Exactly one source per call:

- `html` — the complete document inline. Empty string clears the canvas
  (a clear drops any contract; a blank page accepts nothing).
- `fromArtifact: {filename, sessionId?, expectedSha256?}` — render a stored
  HTML artifact **server-side**: bytes move store→canvas and never enter the
  model's context. `sessionId` defaults to the calling session. The sha
  precondition refuses without drawing on mismatch. Provenance
  (`source: {kind, sessionId, filename, sha256}`) rides the event and the
  activity feed line (`[canvas] rev N from <file>`).

Optional on either source: `note` (revision caption) and `responseContract`
(interactivity, below). `name` assigns a friendly slot label up to 60
characters; omitting it preserves the current name.

**The tool result is the interface card** — rev, size, source, the embedded
manifest summary, and the *effective* contract (post-precedence,
post-normalization: exactly what the browser will enforce). Never the HTML.
This is how an agent that drew a stored app without reading it can interpret
incoming actions and author ticks.

### `update_canvas`

A JSON data tick: `{data, note?, slot?}` → a durable `session.canvas_data` event
(payload inline, ≤32 KB serialized, monotonic `dataRev`). The page receives
`{type: "canvas-data", data, dataRev}` via postMessage and applies it with an
idempotent `applyData(data)`; the platform replays the latest tick into any
freshly loaded page. Ticks never steal the screen and write no chat line, but
they do mark the canvas unseen (the toggle badges). Ticks against a
never-drawn canvas are refused. Layout change = redraw; content change = tick.

### `show_canvas`

Presents an already-drawn slot without changing its bytes or revision. It
records `session.canvas_presented {slot, rev}` and asks the portal to open that
canvas or switch slots. It creates no unseen state and obeys the same active
session, freshness, and per-slot dismissal guards as draw-driven presentation.
Use it when conversation returns to an existing visual; use `draw_canvas` or
`update_canvas` when the content itself changes.

### `read_canvas`

Paged text (`slot` plus `offset`/`maxBytes`) — or `manifestOnly: true` for the
interface card without the bytes: the embedded manifest summary plus the
**armed** contract from that slot's latest draw event (re-validated on the way
out). This is the re-learning path after context regeneration or for an agent
that inherited a canvas it did not draw.

## Interactivity: the response contract

A canvas becomes interactive when the draw carries a `responseContract`:

```jsonc
{ "actions": { "<name>": { "<field>": "string|number|boolean|json" } },  // "?" suffix = optional
  "data": { "example": { } } }   // optional, documents the tick shape (≤1 KB)
```

Caps: 16 actions × 16 fields, 4 KB serialized. The `data` key survives
normalization deliberately — it is what makes "re-read the contract before
ticking so your payload never drifts" a real loop.

The page posts `parent.postMessage({type: "canvas-action", action, data}, "*")`.
The browser then enforces, in order:

1. **Provenance** — the message's source window must be the *live* canvas
   iframe's contentWindow. Staging frames, artifact previews, popups, and
   every other window fail the identity test.
2. **Contract validation, default-closed** — no contract means nothing is
   accepted; unknown actions/fields, wrong types, oversized payloads (8 KB
   serialized, 2048-char strings) are refused. Validation never throws, even
   on structured-clone-legal garbage (cycles, BigInt).
3. **Rate limit** — burst 3 per 3 s per session.
4. **Creator-only, fail-closed** — the server accepts a canvas action only
   from the session creator (`viewerIsOwner`); shared writers and admins are
   refused, and a missing/unloaded snapshot refuses. The client mirrors the
   check for UX; the server is authoritative. Rationale: shared viewers see a
   UI whose state may have mutated — only the creator's view is known to
   correspond to what the agent drew.

Conforming actions arrive as user messages
`[canvas-action] {"action": ..., "data": ...}` — self-labeling, hidden from
the portal chat pane (the redraw is the visible half of the loop), visible to
the agent, and excluded from auto-titling. Agents answer on the canvas, not
in chat.

## Shared state: the KV store

An interactive app holds state that several people change at once. That
state lives in the canvas KV store (migration 0064, `canvas_kv`): one row
per `(session, slot, key)`, the value is an envelope `{ v, by, at }` stamped
server-side, `rev` is the compare-and-swap token, deletes are tombstones.
Every write fires one NOTIFY on the canvas plane (`kind: "kv"`), so every
viewer sees the change in ~50 ms with no redraw and no agent turn.

```
Door 1  signed-in browser   readCanvasKv / writeCanvasKv   (canvas:read / canvas:write → session read)
Door 2  link bearer         GET /api/canvas-share/kv?t=     (read only until phase 4)
Door 3  the agent           canvas_kv { op: get|put|list|delete }

all three → packages/sdk/src/canvas-kv.ts, the one place the rules live
```

Who may write is two switches, both owner-controlled: the canvas policy
(`setCanvasKvAccess`: `owner` | `readers` | `link`, in the share dialog) and
the app's manifest (`"kv": { "write": "viewers", "shared": ["app/task/*"] }`).
Session writers always write (they could launder a write through the
agent). Reserved prefixes: `cfg/` (owner + agent), `evt/` (agent → page),
`ui/<writer>` (each viewer's own), `req/` (a collaborator's request is
capped to `status: "suggested"`; only the owner or the agent queues). Other
rows are author-bound unless the manifest shares the prefix. Limits: 200-char
keys, 16 KB values, 1000 keys and 2 MB per canvas, 10 writes/s per viewer.

The page talks to the host with `canvas-kv` (ops `ready | get | list | put |
delete`) and receives `canvas-kv-ready`, `canvas-kv-result` and
`canvas-kv-change`; the `canvas-apps` skill ships the `CanvasKV()` helper a
page pastes. Nothing is injected into the document.

## The app catalog: publish and find

A published app is one every session in the deployment can find and draw.
Two system tools, no schema:

```
publish_canvas_app({ name, description, tags?, slot? })
   canvas bytes            → pinned artifact app-<name>.html on the session
   manifest + armed contract + source → SHARED fact apps/<name>   (the card)
find_canvas_app({ query })
   enhanced store  → searchFacts(hybrid, namespace "apps", scope shared)
   base store      → read apps/* and rank by term overlap
read_facts({ key_pattern: "apps/<name>", scope: "shared" })  → the full card
draw_canvas({ fromArtifact: card.source })                     → on screen
```

The card is derived from the document's `CANVAS-APP-MANIFEST`, never from
the model's memory of it, and **publish refuses a manifest without an
`interface` block**: `keys` (which KV keys, who writes them, an example
value), `requests` (which `req/*` ops the page queues, their args and the
`result` it renders), `events` (which `evt/*` notes it shows). That block is
what an agent that never read the HTML drives the app from. Code:
`packages/sdk/src/canvas-app-catalog.ts`; manifest grammar and caps in
`canvas-app-manifest.ts`.

Publishing is a disclosure — the shared fact and the artifact are readable
by every session — so the rule is *publish the shell, never the data*.
Republishing a name replaces the card and the artifact. The facts stats
views bucket the namespace as `apps` (facts migration 0012).

## Canvas apps: save and reuse

A canvas worth drawing twice is an app. Convention: one comment immediately
after `<!doctype html>` —

```html
<!-- CANVAS-APP-MANIFEST
{ "manifestVersion": 1, "name": "...", "version": "...", "description": "...",
  "responseContract": { "actions": { ... } },
  "data": "tick shape notes", "notes": "usage notes" }
-->
```

- Only a comment that **opens** with the marker is a manifest — prose or
  script text mentioning the convention is ignored, and a broken manifest is
  distinguishable from an absent one.
- The embedded contract passes the **same normalizer** as the tool argument.
  Precedence at draw time: explicit `responseContract` argument → manifest
  contract → none. An invalid embedded contract fails a `fromArtifact` draw
  closed; an inline draw tolerates a broken manifest but warns in the result.
- Prose fields clamp at 400 chars (surrogate-safe) so cards stay cheap.

The lifecycle, with no byte ever entering model context:

```
draw_canvas(html: ...)                                  # build live, manifest embedded
write_artifact({fromArtifact: {filename: "canvas.html"},
                filename: "app-<name>.html"})          # server-side save-as
read_artifact({sessionId, filename, manifestOnly: true})  # browse candidates
draw_canvas({fromArtifact: {filename: "app-<name>.html"}})  # reuse; result = interface card
```

Cross-session sources ride the platform's worker-trusted artifact layer, the
same trust `read_artifact`/`write_artifact` already extend — the drawing
agent vouches for what it draws. Package-shipped apps (`fromPackage`) and
portal browse affordances are designed but unshipped (canvas-apps.md
phases 2–3).

## Presentation

The portal renders the selected canvas in a sandboxed iframe
(`allow-scripts allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox`, no
`allow-same-origin`, `allow="autoplay *"` — an opaque origin can never match
the default `'src'` allowlist). New revisions load through a visible
under-stack double buffer and promote by z-order only, so a redraw never
white-flashes and iOS registers the frame for touch scrolling. Frames are
kept alive off-screen (transform-parked, `inert`) to preserve page state
across toggles.

**Resizes reflow; they never reload.** A page that loaded at a real size owns
its layout — the inner window receives genuine resize events. The only
automatic reload rescues documents that loaded against a degenerate box (the
iframe's intrinsic default before layout). In-memory state — game progress,
form drafts — survives window drags and rotations. (The artifact *reader*
pane is different: it reloads on width settles; stateful pages belong on the
canvas.)

Viewed-marking comes only from the frame's own promote receipt while visible
— never from mode transitions — so the unseen badge (draws and ticks both
set it) means what it says.

## Availability and limits

- **Every session may own canvases.** Root sessions and sub-agents receive the
  same canvas declarations and handlers. Each session owns its own slots;
  drawing in a child does not mutate the parent's canvases.
- **Slots**: 1–5, default 1. Revisions, names, latest ticks, stored artifacts,
  and dismissal/view state are independent per slot.
- **Caps**: document ≤900 KB (store text cap is 1 MiB); ticks ≤32 KB;
  contract 16×16 fields / 4 KB (+1 KB `data`); action payloads ≤8 KB with
  2048-char strings; card prose 400 chars/field.
- **Authoring rules** (enforced by the sandbox, taught by the `html-visuals`
  skill): fully self-contained, no network, no storage; `parent` property
  reads throw — `parent.postMessage` is the one allowed call; colors on
  `html, body`; 16 px+ inputs; audio unlocks on `touchend`/`click` (never
  `touchstart` alone) plus `navigator.audioSession = "playback"` where
  available.
