# Facts Table — Design Specification

## Overview

The facts table is a durable structured-memory layer for PilotSwarm agents. It provides a PostgreSQL-backed key/value store that agents can use for session-scoped working memory and cross-session shared knowledge. Facts survive process restarts and are automatically cleaned up when sessions are deleted.

## Motivation

LLM conversations are lossy — context windows are finite, chat history can be truncated, and agent sessions may be replayed on different workers after a crash. Agents need a reliable way to persist:

- user instructions and preferences
- task state, checkpoints, and resumable progress
- identifiers, URLs, configuration values, baselines
- cross-agent handoff state

The facts table provides this as a first-class, always-available tool for every session.

### Component Responsibilities

| Component | Role |
|-----------|------|
| `PgFactStore` | PostgreSQL-backed implementation of the `FactStore` interface. Handles connection pooling, schema creation, and all CRUD operations. |
| `createFactTools()` | Factory that produces three Copilot SDK `Tool` objects (`store_fact`, `read_facts`, `delete_fact`) wired to a `FactStore`. |
| `SessionManager` | Owns the `FactStore` instance and injects fact tools into every `ManagedSession`'s tool set. |
| `PilotSwarmWorker` | Creates and initializes the `PgFactStore` during `start()`, then passes it to `SessionManager` and sweeper tools. |
| `PilotSwarmClient` | Creates its own `PgFactStore` for client-side cleanup (e.g., `deleteSession` removes session facts). |
| `cleanup_session` (sweeper) | Deletes session-scoped facts for the root session and all descendants during cleanup. |

Shared facts whose keys start with `intake/` also wake the Facts Manager after
the write commits. Session-scoped `intake/*` facts and shared non-intake facts do
not enqueue a wake-up; the 6-hour Facts Manager maintenance cron is the fallback
for missed or unavailable reactive wake-ups.

## Database Schema

### Table: `{schema}.facts`

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS pilotswarm_facts.facts (
    id          BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    scope_key   TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    key         TEXT NOT NULL,
    value       JSONB NOT NULL,
    agent_id    TEXT,
    session_id  TEXT,
    shared      BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE,
    transient   BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE,
    tags        TEXT[] NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}',
    created_at  TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
    updated_at  TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
    CHECK (NOT (shared AND transient))
);
```

This block shows the baseline table. Later migrations add columns the rest of
this doc relies on: `deleted_at TIMESTAMPTZ` and `etag BIGINT` (migration
`0010_soft_delete_etag` — soft-delete tombstones and crawl-write protection)
and `last_crawled_at` (crawl-queue bookkeeping).

### Column Semantics

| Column | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `scope_key` | Composite uniqueness key. `shared:<key>` for shared facts, `session:<sessionId>:<key>` for session-scoped facts. Ensures one fact per key per scope. |
| `key` | Human-readable fact identifier (e.g., `baseline/tps`, `infra/server/fqdn`). |
| `value` | JSON-serializable payload stored as JSONB. |
| `agent_id` | Optional provenance — which agent stored the fact. |
| `session_id` | The session that owns the fact. `NULL` is technically possible for shared facts but the storing session's ID is still recorded. |
| `shared` | `true` = globally visible across all sessions. `false` = session-scoped, only visible to the owning session. |
| `transient` | Mutually exclusive with `shared` (enforced by CHECK constraint). Session-scoped facts are transient; shared facts are not. |
| `tags` | Array of string tags for categorized querying (e.g., `["build", "ci"]`). Uses GIN index for array containment queries. |

### Indexes

- `idx_*_facts_key` — B-tree on `key`
- `idx_*_facts_tags` — GIN on `tags` (supports `@>` containment)
- `idx_*_facts_session` — B-tree on `session_id`
- `idx_*_facts_agent` — B-tree on `agent_id`
- `idx_*_facts_shared` — B-tree on `shared`
- `idx_*_facts_transient` — B-tree on `transient`

### Schema Configuration

The schema name defaults to `pilotswarm_facts` and is configurable via `factsSchema` on both `PilotSwarmWorkerOptions` and `PilotSwarmClientOptions`. Tests use isolated schemas (`pilotswarm_facts_it_<timestamp>_<random>`) for parallel test execution.

## Tool API

### `store_fact`

Stores or upserts one fact, or a batch of facts. Session-scoped by default.

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `key` | string | yes, unless `facts` is set | Fact identifier (e.g., `baseline/tps`) |
| `value` | any | yes, unless `facts` is set | JSON-serializable value |
| `tags` | string[] | no | Tags for filtering |
| `shared` | boolean | no | `true` for cross-session shared fact (default: `false`) |
| `facts` | `{ key, value, tags?, shared? }[]` | no | Batch ingestion form. When present, top-level `key` / `value` are ignored. |

**Behavior:**
- Uses `ON CONFLICT (scope_key) DO UPDATE` — calling `store_fact` with the same key overwrites the previous value.
- The session ID and agent ID are automatically populated from the calling context.
- Returns `{ key, shared, scope: "shared" | "session", stored: true }`.
- Batch form returns `{ stored, facts: [...] }` with the same per-fact result shape.

### `read_facts`

Reads facts visible to the calling session.

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `key_pattern` | string | no | Key pattern with `%` or `*` wildcards |
| `tags` | string[] | no | All listed tags must be present |
| `session_id` | string | no | Provenance filter by source session |
| `agent_id` | string | no | Provenance filter by source agent |
| `limit` | number | no | Max rows (default: 50) |
| `scope` | string | no | `accessible` (default), `shared`, `session`, or `descendants` |

**Scope Semantics:**

| Scope | Returns |
|-------|--------|
| `accessible` | Caller's own session facts + spawn-tree facts (every other session under the same root: ancestors, descendants, siblings, cousins) + all globally-shared facts |
| `shared` | Only globally-shared facts |
| `session` | Only the caller's own session-scoped facts |
| `descendants` | Same spawn-tree visibility as `accessible`, kept as an explicit family-tree view |

**Visibility Rules:**

- Session-scoped facts are visible to every session in the same **spawn tree** — the caller's session, every ancestor on the way up to the root, and every descendant of that root (i.e. siblings and cousins, not just children/grandchildren). The `session_id` parameter is spawn-tree-aware: when a caller passes `session_id=<other>` and `<other>` belongs to the same spawn tree, that session's session-scoped facts become visible. Sessions outside the spawn tree remain inaccessible.
- When `scope=descendants`, the handler resolves the entire spawn tree (root + all descendants of root) and includes those session IDs in the visibility set. It is functionally equivalent to `accessible` today and kept as an explicit family-tree view.
- Lineage / spawn-tree resolution uses the CMS `parent_session_id` tree: the worker walks up to the root ancestor, then expands via the same recursive CTE the sweeper uses for cleanup.

### `delete_fact`

Deletes a fact by exact key, or deletes matching keys when explicitly requested.

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `key` | string | yes | Fact key to delete |
| `shared` | boolean | no | `true` to delete the shared fact; `false` (default) to delete the caller's session-scoped fact |
| `pattern` | boolean | no | Must be `true` to treat `key` as a pattern. Supports `*` globs and SQL `%` wildcards. |
| `scope` | string | no | Pattern-delete scope: `session`, `shared`, or `all`. `all` is Facts Manager only. |

**Returns:** `{ key, shared, deleted: boolean }`.

For pattern deletes, returns `{ keyPattern, scope, deleted }`. Pattern deletes are opt-in so a key like `a/b/*` is literal unless `pattern=true`. Ordinary task agents can only delete facts they own; the Facts Manager can use `scope="all"` for shared and session cleanup.

## Scoping and Lifecycle

### Session-Scoped Facts (default)

- Visible to the owning session via `scope=session`, and to every session in the same spawn tree via `scope=accessible`, `scope=descendants`, or `session_id=<tree-member>`.
- Not visible outside the spawn tree.
- Automatically deleted when the session is deleted (via `deleteSessionFactsForSession()`).
- Upsert key: `session:<sessionId>:<key>`.

### Shared Facts

- Visible to all sessions via `scope=accessible` or `scope=shared`.
- Persist indefinitely until explicitly deleted with `delete_fact(key, shared=true)`.
- Upsert key: `shared:<key>`.
- Not cleaned up by session deletion or sweeper cleanup.

### Cleanup Flow

1. **`client.deleteSession(sessionId)`** — calls `factStore.deleteSessionFactsForSession(sessionId)` to remove all session-scoped facts.
2. **Sweeper `cleanup_session`** — iterates through `getDescendantSessionIds()` and calls `deleteSessionFactsForSession()` for each descendant, then for the root session.
3. Shared facts are never automatically deleted.

## Integration Points

### Worker Initialization

```
PilotSwarmWorker.start()
  → createFactStoreForUrl(store, factsSchema)
  → factStore.initialize()
  → sessionManager.setFactStore(factStore)
  → createSweeperTools({ ..., factStore })
```

### Session Creation

```
SessionManager.getOrCreate()
  → createFactTools({ factStore })
  → inject into CopilotSession tool set alongside system tools, sub-agent tools, and user tools
```

Facts tools are re-registered on every `runTurn()` call as part of the standard tool set.

### Default Agent Prompt

The `default.agent.md` includes a `## Facts Table` section that instructs the LLM to use facts aggressively for durable memory. Key guidance:

- Treat conversational memory as lossy — write important state to facts.
- Session-scoped by default, use `shared=true` only for cross-spawn-tree or global knowledge.
- Read relevant facts before resuming long-running or multi-agent work.
- Respond to user "remember" / "forget" requests via facts tools immediately.
- During multi-agent work, use `read_facts(session_id=<tree-member>)` or `scope=descendants` to pull facts from peers and descendants in the same spawn tree.

## Enhanced Facts & Knowledge Graph (optional)

The base facts table above is always present. Two **optional, independently
injected** providers extend it. They are wired through config only — code that
uses `store_fact` / `read_facts` / `delete_fact` is unchanged whether or not they
are present. See [Configuration](../developer/reference/configuration.md#enhanced-facts--knowledge-graph-optional)
for the worker/client knobs, and [Deploying a Knowledge Harvester](../developer/deploy/harvester.md)
to run ingestion as a dedicated service over a shared HorizonDB.

### Two orthogonal axes

| Axis | Provider | Lights up |
|------|----------|-----------|
| **Facts capability** | `EnhancedFactStore` (HorizonDB: pgvector + pg_textsearch + pg_durable) | `facts_search`, `facts_similar`, `search_skills` |
| **Graph presence** | `GraphStore` (Apache AGE) | `graph_search_nodes`, `graph_search_edges`, `graph_neighbourhood`, + graph writes and crawler crawl/reconcile surface |

They are **independent**: an enhanced fact store with no graph gets search tools
but no graph tools; a base fact store with a graph gets the full graph surface
but no search tools. Graph tools key off **graph presence alone**
(`graphDatabaseUrl` set / `!!graphStore`) — never the facts capability. The
runtime asks `isEnhancedFactStore(store)` once at boot and threads the answer
through; it never sniffs per turn.

```typescript
// Capability descriptor the runtime reads to gate enhanced tools.
interface FactsCapabilities { search: boolean; embedder: boolean; }
```

`facts_search` / `facts_similar` / `search_skills` register only when the store
is an `EnhancedFactStore` **and** `capabilities.search` is true. The embedder
only affects semantic ranking and prompt wording — with `embedder: false`,
search still registers and runs in lexical/hybrid mode.

When a batch embed fails, the durable embedder marks those rows with its internal
retry marker and retries them one by one before selecting fresh batch work. When
a single row still cannot be embedded, it records a numeric internal
`last_embed_error` on that fact and continues with later rows. A subsequent
content change clears the error, putting the row back into normal batched
embedding. Store users do not need to read this field; it is embedder state.
Known internal codes are:

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `1001` | Input too large for the embedding model. |
| `1400` | Provider rejected the row/request as bad input. |
| `1401` | Provider authentication failed. |
| `1403` | Provider authorization failed. |
| `1429` | Provider rate limited the row request. |
| `1500` | Provider/server returned a 5xx response. |
| `1901` | Provider returned a malformed embedding payload. |
| `9999` | Unknown terminal embedding failure. |

### Enhanced retrieval replaces the capped skills push

On a base store, the framework injects a capped slice of curated skills into the
system prompt every turn. On an enhanced store that push is **dropped**; instead
the agent gets a dedicated `search_skills` tool for explicit skill requests and
non-obvious questions or workflows that the current context does not resolve.
Greetings, simple arithmetic, status checks, and follow-ups can be answered
directly when context suffices. Relevant loaded skills are reused; another
search is appropriate for a new knowledge gap or an explicit request. Each
search returns ranked relevant skills, whose full instructions must be loaded
before use, instead of an arbitrary slice on every turn. The agent can also
retrieve its own past `intake/*` observations via `facts_search`.

### The knowledge graph

The graph stores **ids + structure only** — never fact values or ACLs. Nodes
(`kind`, `name`, `aliases`) and edges (free-text `predicate`, `confidence`,
`observations`) carry optional **evidence**: fact `scopeKey` pointers that anchor
a node/edge to the facts that justify it. Resolving evidence back to fact values
is a tool-layer composition across the two separate providers:

```
graph_search_nodes(...) -> node.evidence (scopeKeys) -> read_facts({ scopeKeys })
```

- **Seeds pivot.** A query seeded with a fact `scopeKey` pivots into the graph via
  the `EVIDENCED_BY` anchor; a node-key seed expands directly.
- **Reinforcement.** Re-asserting the same `(fromKey, predicate, toKey)` does not
  duplicate — it bumps `observations` and combines confidence (noisy-OR) only
  when **new** evidence is supplied; same-evidence replays are harmless no-ops.

### The crawl queue (crawler work queue)

Every base fact carries a `scopeKey` and a `last_crawled_at` stamp. Facts with
`last_crawled_at IS NULL` (new or edited since the last crawl) are the
**crawler work queue**:

- `facts_read_uncrawled({ keyPrefix?, namespace?, limit? })` — returns queued facts,
  each with its `scopeKey` + `etag` receipt (and `deletedAt` when the fact is a
  tombstone). `keyPrefix` is a literal key prefix; `namespace` remains a deprecated
  alias for the same read filter.
- `facts_set_crawled({ scopeKeys: [{ scopeKey, etag }], crawled?: true })` — stamps
  processed facts as incorporated so they leave the queue. Include `etag` to make each
  entry conditional; omit it only for an intentional stomp. A skipped entry means the
  fact was already in the target state, changed since your read (etag mismatch), or no
  longer exists.
- `facts_set_crawled({ keyPrefix, crawled })` — flips a whole literal prefix. Use
  `crawled:false` to requeue a prefix for recrawl; `crawled:true` is a coarse flush and
  skips tombstones, which should be reconciled with `graph_remove_evidence` and marked
  by `scopeKeys`.

### The crawler role

Active graph harvesting is **app-specific** (deciding *what* to crawl and *how* to
extract entities/edges is domain knowledge PilotSwarm cannot supply generically),
but the **tools** are shipped by PilotSwarm:

- An **app crawler agent** (an agent the operator marks with `crawler: true`; legacy
  `harvester: true` remains an alias) is the active crawler — it is granted the crawl queue,
  graph evidence reconciliation, namespace archive, broad corpus fact access, and app-specific
  extraction guidance.
- The **`facts-manager`** holds the same crawler tools but is **dormant** — not
  prompted to crawl, so nothing is harvested out of the box. It additionally gets
  read-only `graph_stats` to *report* on graph size / last-crawled time.
- A crawler should **resolve before it creates**: `graph_search_nodes` by
  `nameLike` first, then `graph_upsert_node` with the source fact's `scopeKey` as
  evidence — this is what makes reinforcement dedup work.
- Graph tools accept the same `namespace` concept as the crawl/search tools.
  `namespace: "corpus/acme"` matches graph nodes/edges stamped exactly with
  `corpus/acme` and descendants such as `corpus/acme/services`. Use the same
  namespace string for `facts_read_uncrawled({ keyPrefix })`, `facts_search`,
  `graph_search_*`, `graph_upsert_*`, `graph_neighbourhood`, `graph_stats`,
  merge, and delete operations so a crawler can discover or maintain one
  corpus/domain without enumerating seed nodes first.

### Access control (evidence is ACL-filtered, topology is shared)

Graph **topology** (which nodes/edges exist, how they connect) is shared across
all readers. Graph **evidence arrays** are ACL-filtered per caller exactly like
facts: a reader sees only the evidence `scopeKey`s it could read via `read_facts`
(its own session, its spawn-tree lineage, and shared facts). An inaccessible fact
seed is treated as unknown — indistinguishable from a non-existent seed, so it is
not an existence oracle.

Graph reads use the **same lineage resolver as `read_facts`**: the runtime threads
the caller's `AccessContext` (`readerSessionId` + granted lineage `sessionIds`,
self-excluded and deduped) into every graph read. A reader with no lineage sees
its own session only — never an unrestricted/wildcard scope.

### agent-tuner is strictly read-only

The `agent-tuner` investigator gets **every read tool** — base `read_facts`,
`facts_search` / `facts_similar`, `search_skills`, the graph reads, and
`graph_stats` — with graph reads resolving **unrestricted** (it is the privileged
investigator). It is **never** granted a write, delete, crawl, or mutating control
tool, even if a stale config sets the crawler/legacy harvester flag. The sweeper is unchanged: it
sweeps facts via the existing cascading session delete and never touches graph
nodes.

### Testing

- Provider-level conformance + ACL/crawl/graph semantics: `packages/horizon-store/test/integration/*` (gated on `HORIZON_DATABASE_URL`).
- SDK capability×role tool gating + prompt adaptation (DB-less): [`packages/sdk/test/local/enhanced-tool-gating.test.js`](../../packages/sdk/test/local/enhanced-tool-gating.test.js) and [`graph-tools-gating.test.js`](../../packages/sdk/test/local/graph-tools-gating.test.js).
- SDK real-provider composition (base PgFactStore + real graph, crawl→harvest→resolve round-trip, gated on `HORIZON_DATABASE_URL`): [`packages/sdk/test/local/enhanced-composition.integration.test.js`](../../packages/sdk/test/local/enhanced-composition.integration.test.js).

## Constraints

- **PostgreSQL only.** The `createFactStoreForUrl()` factory rejects non-Postgres URLs. SQLite is not supported for facts.
- **No SQLite fallback.** Unlike the CMS and duroxide stores which support SQLite for local development, facts are Postgres-exclusive.
- **No hard row cap.** `readFacts` defaults to 50 rows per query. Callers can raise the `limit` parameter as needed.
- **No cross-spawn-tree access for private facts.** A session cannot read the session-scoped facts of any session outside its own spawn tree. Within a spawn tree (everything under a common root: ancestors, descendants, siblings, cousins), session-scoped facts are visible via `scope=accessible`, `scope=descendants`, or `session_id=<other-tree-member>`. Spawn-tree membership is verified via the CMS `parent_session_id` chain.

## Public API Exports

From `src/index.ts`:

```typescript
export { PgFactStore, createFactStoreForUrl } from "./facts-store.js";
export type { FactStore, FactRecord, StoreFactInput, ReadFactsQuery, DeleteFactInput } from "./facts-store.js";
export { createFactTools } from "./facts-tools.js";

// Enhanced facts + knowledge graph (optional providers)
export { isEnhancedFactStore, resolveFactsTarget, createGraphStoreForUrl } from "./facts-store.js";
export type { EnhancedFactStore, FactsCapabilities, AccessContext } from "./facts-store.js";
export type { GraphStore } from "./graph-store.js";
export { createGraphTools } from "./graph-tools.js";
```

These are available to applications that need direct fact store access outside of
the tool layer. The concrete enhanced/graph providers ship separately in
`pilotswarm-horizon-store` and are loaded by the worker only when configured.
