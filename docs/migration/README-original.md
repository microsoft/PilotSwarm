# PilotSwarm

> **Experimental** — This project is under active development and not yet ready for production use. APIs may change without notice.

> **Latest release: v0.5.78** — Faster desktop navigation, clearer activity cards, session timestamps, and bring-your-own PostgreSQL deployment.

A durable execution runtime for [GitHub Copilot SDK](https://github.com/github/copilot-sdk) agents. Crash recovery, durable timers, session dehydration, and multi-node scaling — powered by [duroxide](https://github.com/microsoft/duroxide). Just add a connection string.

For the fastest first run, start with the [Docker Quickstart Guide](./docs/quickstart/docker.md).

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for release notes.

## Builder Agents

If you are building layered apps on top of PilotSwarm, this repo now ships distributable builder-agent templates you can copy into your own repository:

- [Builder Agent Templates](./docs/developer/building/builder-agents.md)
- [DevOps Command Center Sample](examples/devops-command-center/README.md)
- [Horizon Harvester Sample](examples/horizon-harvester/README.md) — optional enhanced facts + knowledge graph

These are not active agents in this repo. They are templates intended to be copied into a user repo under `.github/agents/` and `.github/skills/`.

## Quick Start

Three paths:

### Try it from this repo (3 minutes)

The Docker quickstart is the fastest first run. One image, browser portal,
local PostgreSQL, two embedded workers — set `GITHUB_TOKEN` and go:

→ [Docker Quickstart Guide](./docs/quickstart/docker.md)

If you'd rather run from source instead of Docker:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/affandar/pilotswarm.git
cd pilotswarm && npm install && npm run build

cp .env.example .env
cp .model_providers.example.json .model_providers.json
# edit .env: set DATABASE_URL and at least one LLM provider key.
# easiest: GITHUB_TOKEN (gives Claude, GPT-4.1, etc. via GitHub Copilot).

./run.sh local --db   # launches Postgres + workers + TUI
```

→ [Full source-based getting started](./docs/quickstart/local.md)

### Use as a library in your own app

```bash
npm install pilotswarm-sdk
```

```typescript
import { PilotSwarmClient, PilotSwarmWorker, defineTool } from "pilotswarm-sdk";

const getWeather = defineTool("get_weather", {
    description: "Get weather for a city",
    parameters: {
        type: "object",
        properties: { city: { type: "string" } },
        required: ["city"],
    },
    handler: async ({ city }) => {
        const res = await fetch(`https://wttr.in/${city}?format=j1`);
        return await res.json();
    },
});

// Worker runs LLM turns + tools. In production it lives in its own
// long-running process (see "Durability" below); here we co-locate for demo.
const worker = new PilotSwarmWorker({ store: process.env.DATABASE_URL });
worker.registerTools([getWeather]);
await worker.start();

// Direct { store } client only because this single-process demo co-locates
// worker and client. Apps talking to a real deployment use web mode
// ({ apiUrl }) — see "Connect to a shared deployment" below.
const client = new PilotSwarmClient({ store: process.env.DATABASE_URL });
await client.start();

const session = await client.createSession({
    toolNames: ["get_weather"],
    systemMessage: "You are a weather assistant.",
});
const response = await session.sendAndWait("What's the weather in NYC?");
console.log(response);

await client.stop();
await worker.stop();
```

A worker-registered tool can keep durable state per session without touching
SDK internals. Its handler receives `invocation.facts`, bound to the calling
session; the model never sees it, and nothing under the `tools/` key prefix is
readable, writable, or searchable by any agent through the fact tools:

```typescript
const proxy = defineTool("call_service", {
    description: "Call the external service for this session",
    parameters: { type: "object", properties: { query: { type: "string" } }, required: ["query"] },
    handler: async ({ query }, ctx) => {
        // Exact read, this session only. `{ scope: "root" }` binds to the spawn
        // tree's root session; `{ scope: "shared" }` is cluster-wide.
        let binding = await ctx.facts?.read("tools/my-service/binding");
        if (!binding) {
            binding = await openExternalSession(ctx.durableSessionId);
            await ctx.facts?.store("tools/my-service/binding", binding);
            binding = await ctx.facts?.read("tools/my-service/binding"); // adopt the winner if two replicas raced
        }
        return callService(binding, query);
    },
});
```

Reserve more prefixes for tools with `new PilotSwarmWorker({ reservedFactPrefixes: ["bindings/"] })`.
Design: `docs/proposals/tool-context-facts-accessor.md`.

PilotSwarm's own framework prompt and management plugins ship embedded inside `pilotswarm-sdk`. Apps layer their own `plugin/` directories on top; they do not need to copy the framework's built-in plugin text into their own repos.

### Connect to a shared deployment

Already have a PilotSwarm deployment (see [Deploying to AKS](./docs/developer/deploy/aks.md))? The portal hosts a versioned Web API (HTTP `/api/v1` + WebSocket `/api/v1/ws`), so clients need exactly one value — the portal URL.

Attach the TUI:

```bash
npx pilotswarm remote --api-url https://portal.example.com
```

No `DATABASE_URL`, no `kubectl` — logs stream over the API, and if the deployment uses Entra auth the TUI opens your browser for an interactive sign-in (`pilotswarm auth login|status|logout --api-url <url>` to manage it; `--device-code` for headless hosts).

Or connect from your own app with the SDK's web mode:

```typescript
const client = new PilotSwarmClient({ apiUrl: "https://portal.example.com" });
await client.start();
// Session handles work exactly as in the demo above: send, sendAndWait, on, ...
```

`PilotSwarmManagementClient({ apiUrl })` works the same way. Prefer the raw API or a browser? The zero-dependency [`pilotswarm-sdk/api`](packages/sdk/api/README.md) package speaks the same contract — see the [Web API Reference](docs/api/reference.md). Direct `{ store }` client construction remains available for worker/portal embedding and internal testing only; workers always use `{ store }`.

### Durability — recurring and long-waiting agents

The single-process demo above doesn't show the durability story because the
process exits as soon as the response lands. To run an agent that pauses for
hours or runs a recurring schedule, the worker has to be a long-running
process — typically:

- one or more `PilotSwarmWorker`s in their own service (locally with `npm run worker`, in production on Kubernetes), and
- clients (CLI, TUI, browser portal, or your app) connecting through the portal's [Web API](docs/api/reference.md)

The agent then calls `wait(...)` for one-shot delays, or `cron(...)` for
recurring schedules. Long waits dehydrate the session to blob storage; any
worker rehydrates it when the timer fires. See [Architecture](./docs/architecture/system.md)
and [Building SDK Apps](./docs/developer/building/sdk-apps.md) for the full pattern.

## What You Get

| Feature | Copilot SDK | PilotSwarm |
|---------|-------------|---------------------|
| Tool calling | ✅ | ✅ Same `defineTool()` API |
| Wait/pause | ❌ Blocks process | ✅ Durable timer — process shuts down, resumes later |
| Crash recovery | ❌ Session lost | ✅ Automatic resume from last state |
| Multi-node | ❌ Single process | ✅ Sessions migrate between worker pods |
| Session persistence | ❌ In-memory | ✅ PostgreSQL + Azure Blob Storage |
| Event streaming | ❌ Local only | ✅ Cross-process event subscriptions |

## How It Works

The runtime automatically injects `wait` and `cron` tools into every session. When the LLM needs to pause or schedule recurring work:

1. **Short waits** (< 30s) — sleep in-process
2. **Long waits** (≥ 30s) — dehydrate session to blob storage → durable timer → any worker hydrates and continues
3. **Recurring schedules** — use `cron(...)` so the orchestration re-arms itself automatically after each cycle
