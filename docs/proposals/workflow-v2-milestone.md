# Workflow v2 milestone: implementation notes (inactive)

Status: **inactive**. Everything in this note runs only on controller 1.9.0
and the orchestrations it starts, which only tests register (the worker
option `workflowRequests`) and only a test host starts runs at
(`WorkflowV2Host.requests`). Production workers keep controller 1.8.0, its
activities and its tool surface unchanged. Nothing here is an activation, a
deployment or a qualification result.

The approved design is the execution package of 31 October 2026 (documents
01 to 11, requirements R01 to R28). Request states have their own design
note, [workflow-messaging-request.md](workflow-messaging-request.md). This
note records how the other milestone features are implemented and where the
implementation is narrower than the design.

## Graceful stop (design 02 run lifecycle, D03)

`update_workflow` operation `stop` (run id optional, `reason` optional,
`grace_seconds` 0 to 3600, default 60):

1. The store accepts the stop once per operation id
   (`WorkflowStore.requestRunStop`, migration 0096). One reading of the
   store's clock is the stop's time; the deadline is that reading plus the
   grace. A repeat returns the receipt; another stop of a stopping run is
   `RUN_ALREADY_STOPPING`.
2. Only a run admitted for a controller that stops is accepted. Each run
   now records the controller version its admission chose
   (`workflow_runs.controller_version`). Runs admitted for 1.8.0, and runs
   admitted before migration 0096, are refused with `RUN_STOP_UNSUPPORTED`;
   cancel still applies to them.
3. A stopping run admits no new node execution, paused or not
   (`enterNode` refuses `stopping`). Pause and resume refuse it
   (`RUN_STOPPING`). A cancel, a deletion and KV updates still apply, and
   the first run end stands.
4. Controller 1.9.0 learns of the stop from a refused admission or from its
   collection (which reports the stop's deadline after the results), and
   from then on routes no result: work it admitted settles and keeps its
   result, and no successor, catch-all state or unhandled-route failure
   follows from it.
5. When no work is pending, or at the deadline by the store's clock, the
   stop activity ends the run `stopped` (`finishStoppedRun`). Work still
   pending at the deadline is cancelled with winner `stop`; the effect of
   each such script is asked to stop (`workflow.cancel_requested`, `stop:
   true`), and a running script's liveness check stops it too. The run's
   terminal error records the stop: code `stopped`, its reason, actor and
   grace, whether the grace expired, and the node executions it cancelled.
6. The parent is told as for any other end. The session row shows
   `cancelled` (session statuses have no `stopped`); the run status is
   `stopped`, and `read_workflow` shows the stop with `settled` while the
   run is active.

Wait, receive and request states are work like any other here: a wait that
elapses within the grace settles, and one that does not is cancelled at the
deadline.

The tool takes `stop` only on a host that starts runs at 1.9.0; elsewhere it
is refused as an unknown operation, exactly as before. The tool's published
description and parameter enum are unchanged.

Not yet covered: the UI read model's `stopped` label, REST/MCP parity and
the formal lifecycle model's stop transitions.

## Agent states (design 03 agent node; R09 to R11, R14, R15, R23)

A state of `type: agent` runs an ordinary child agent session and is
finished only by that child's typed completion, raced against an outer
deadline. It compiles to IR 8 only when agent states are enabled (the
compile option `enableAgents`, set with `enableRequests` by a host that
starts 1.9.0 runs); elsewhere it stays unsupported, exactly as before. A
reader takes IR 8 only when asked to (`WORKFLOW_V2_MILESTONE_IR_VERSION`).

```yaml
review:
  type: agent
  invoke: { prompt: "Review this exact change. Do not edit source." }
  # or: invoke: { agent: { name: code-reviewer, package: review-kit, version: "1.2.0" } }
  inputSchema: { $ref: "#/schemas/ReviewInput" }
  outputSchema: { $ref: "#/schemas/ReviewResult" }
  timeoutSeconds: 900
  transition: { next: { accepted: done, changes_required: rework, needs_input: ask, timed_out: blocked, failure: failed } }
```

- **Task.** Exactly one of an inline `prompt` (at most 32 KiB) or a named
  `agent`. A package `version` needs its `package`. A package's
  `workflowInterface` is not supported yet: the state's own `inputSchema`
  and `outputSchema` are its contract.
- **Outcomes.** Declared with `outcomes`, or by default the state's routes
  that are not runtime routes. The agent may also report `needs_input` or
  `execution_failed`; every other runtime code (`timed_out`, `unavailable`,
  `forbidden`, `invalid_output`, `cancelled`) is decided by the workflow.
- **Admission.** The input is checked against `inputSchema`. The deadline
  is the admission's store-clock reading plus `timeoutSeconds` (a literal or
  one binding, checked on entry). The invocation record (migration 0097)
  freezes the child's session id (a UUID derived from the node execution,
  so a retry names the same session and a later occurrence another), the
  controlling parent agent (the workflow's parent), the task, the outcomes
  and the output schema.
- **The child.** The agent orchestration (`workflow-v2-agent` 1.0.0) asks the
  worker's agent host to create the child and send it one first prompt,
  the host-generated wrapper (`workflowAgentPrompt`), with a stable client
  message id, as the workflow (never as a human). The same wrapper serves
  an inline prompt and a named agent: how to finish the state, the
  validated input, the schemas, the outcomes, the deadline, the controlling
  parent agent, that humans cannot prompt it, then the task. The host
  (`agent-host.ts`) creates the child under the workflow, one level below
  it, at most level 3 (D02), owned as any spawned child is, with the
  controlling agent's model; a named agent is bound to the definition its
  owner sees, with that definition's own tools only. A refusal (unknown,
  system, mismatched pin, too deep) fails the state `unavailable` or
  `forbidden`; a worker without a host fails it `unavailable`.
- **Completion.** `complete_workflow_node` is given only to an agent state's
  child. The caller is the host-stamped session, never an argument. One
  transaction: the call's shape, the operation id (the same id and result
  replays its answer; another result is `OPERATION_CONFLICT`), the store's
  one clock reading against the deadline (durable expiry: once an operation
  was refused `NODE_EXPIRED`, every later one is too), then the contract.
  Field errors leave the state pending (`OUTPUT_INVALID`, with
  `attemptsLeft`); the third invalid completion fails it `invalid_output`.
  A valid one decides the state (winner `agent`) and wakes the controller.
  Final chat text never completes a state.
- **Deadline and end.** Only the controller's elapse decides `timed_out`.
  When the controller collects an agent state's result it ends the child:
  `done` after the agent's own completion, `cancel` after anything else.
  When the run ends (any end), the children of its decided agent states
  are ended too. The end is recorded once and sent while the child's
  session runs; a spawn that created the child after the end found no
  session sends it again.
- **Child chat (R23).** `read_workflow` shows each agent state's
  `agent.childSessionId`, the session a click on the state opens, and its
  lifecycle (spawned, end, end sent).

Not yet covered here: human-input denial and the depth allowance for the
node agent's own child (B5), the UI read model and click-through (B9), a
real-model run of an agent state, and package workflow interfaces.
