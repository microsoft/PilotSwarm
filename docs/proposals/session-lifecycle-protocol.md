# Session Lifecycle Protocol: Checkpoint, Affinity, Hydrate/Dehydrate

Status: proposal (2026-07-04)
Companion: [postgres-blob-store.md](./postgres-blob-store.md) — the storage
backend. This document defines the *protocol* (when state moves, who owns it,
how staleness is detected); the store doc defines *where the bytes live*. The
protocol is backend-agnostic: it runs over Azure Blob or Postgres, though the
PG store implements its contract natively.

---

## 1. The moving parts

Four layers cooperate to run a durable session. Naming them precisely matters
because the protocol is exactly the choreography between them.

**Copilot SDK session (the expensive state).** A process-local directory
(`sessionStateDir/<sessionId>/`: `events.jsonl`, `session.db`, workspace
files) plus a live in-memory SDK session object, on exactly one worker at a
time. Rebuilding it from nothing loses conversation history; moving it means
tar + transfer + resume.

**Session snapshot store (`SessionStateStore`).** `dehydrate` (tar → persist →
**delete local dir**), `hydrate` (fetch → unpack, replacing local dir),
`checkpoint` (tar → persist, **local files kept**), `exists`, `delete`.
Implementations: Azure Blob, filesystem, and (proposed) Postgres.

**Duroxide sessions (lease-based worker affinity).**
`ctx.scheduleActivityOnSession(name, input, key)` routes every activity
carrying the same key to one worker. Mechanics, from the duroxide-pg provider:

- A `sessions` row (`session_id`, `worker_id`, `locked_until`,
  `last_activity_at`) is claimed atomically inside `fetch_work_item`; an
  unclaimed key is claimed by whichever worker fetches first.
- The owner renews a **30 s lock** by heartbeat (fixed; not exposed to Node).
  A crashed owner's sessions are reclaimable within ≤30 s.
- A healthy owner deliberately stops renewing after
  **`session_idle_timeout` = 300 s** of no activity on the key (exposed to
  Node as `sessionIdleTimeoutMs`). Unpin latency = idle timeout + up to one
  lock timeout, so ~5.5 min.
- **`max_sessions_per_runtime` = 10** (exposed) caps concurrently owned keys.
- `workerNodeId` is one identity shared by all concurrency slots of a
  runtime, so any slot on a pod serves that pod's sessions.
- **There is no session-level fencing.** Stale *completions* are blocked per
  work item (lock tokens) and per orchestration (`execution_id` dedup), but
  nothing at the duroxide layer stops a worker holding stale *local files*
  from serving a freshly scheduled activity if the key routes back to it.

**Durable session orchestration (`durableSessionOrchestration`, latest
1.0.56).** Owns the protocol. `state.affinityKey` is a GUID (initially the
sessionId). A session proxy (`createSessionProxy(ctx, sessionId, affinityKey,
config)`) schedules every session-scoped activity — `runTurn`, `hydrate`,
`dehydrate`, `checkpoint` — on that key. Holding affinity = keeping the GUID.
Breaking affinity = `state.affinityKey = yield ctx.newGuid()` + recreating the
proxy; the old key's duroxide row simply decays.

---

## 2. Current protocol (v1.0.56)

### 2.1 Turn execution

`runTurn` is scheduled on `affinityKey`. On the worker, `getOrCreate` resolves
session state in order: in-memory session → resume from local files → **else
fresh-session replay**. The last arm (`session-proxy.ts:860`) records a
`session.lossy_handoff` CMS event
(`recoveryMode: "fresh_session_replay"`), injects a system message telling
the LLM a worker restart lost its state, and starts from `turnIndex: 0`.

Note what is *absent* from that chain: the snapshot store. The worker never
loads from storage on its own — the only load in the whole protocol is the
orchestration-scheduled `hydrate` activity (§2.3), which runs *before*
`runTurn`, gated purely by the orchestration's `needsHydration` flag. So
"resume from local files" covers two cases indistinguishably: the session
never left this worker, or a hydrate activity just unpacked the tar here.
And when the flag and reality disagree — the orchestration believes
`needsHydration = false` but the worker holding the key has no files — the
one load path has already been skipped, and `runTurn` falls through to
fresh replay even when a perfectly good snapshot exists.

### 2.2 After the turn: the wait plan

The LLM ends a turn with `completed`, `wait(seconds)`, `cron`, `cron_at`, or
`input_required`. For known waits, `planWaitHandling` (wait-affinity.ts)
decides:

```
shouldDehydrate            = blobEnabled && seconds > dehydrateThreshold   // default 29 s
preserveAffinityOnHydrate  = shouldDehydrate && preserveWorkerAffinity     // LLM opt-in: wait_on_worker
resetAffinityOnDehydrate   = shouldDehydrate && !preserveAffinityOnHydrate
```

- **Wait ≤ 29 s:** stay live. Orchestration timer; files and SDK session stay
  on the worker; the duroxide lease survives (29 s < 5 min idle unpin).
- **Wait > 29 s:** `dehydrateForNextTurn(reason, resetAffinity)`
  (lifecycle.ts:147): skip if already dehydrated; otherwise the `dehydrate`
  activity runs **on the current GUID** (the owner has the files): destroy
  the in-memory session → tar → upload → delete the local dir. Then
  `needsHydration = true` and, unless the LLM asked `wait_on_worker`, the
  GUID is rotated immediately.
- **No wait (interactive lull):** publish `idle`, arm an **idle timer,
  default 60 s** (`idleTimeout`, state.ts:236). A user prompt inside the
  window cancels it (queue.ts:365). If it fires:
  `dehydrateForNextTurn("idle")` with rotation (turn.ts:1184). So every
  interactive session is fully dehydrated one minute after its last turn.

### 2.3 Resume

On the next event (user message, timer fire), `needsHydration` gates the turn
(turn.ts:278): the GUID is rotated **a second time** unless
`preserveAffinityOnHydrate`, the proxy is recreated, and a `hydrate` activity
is scheduled on the new key. Whichever worker duroxide picks downloads and
unpacks the tar; `runTurn` follows on the same key and resumes from the local
files. The resumed prompt is wrapped with a visible
`[SYSTEM: The session was dehydrated and has been rehydrated on a new
worker…]` context note — every dehydrate cycle spends prompt tokens telling
the model about plumbing.

### 2.4 Checkpoints (existing machinery, effectively off)

`maybeCheckpoint` (lifecycle.ts:190) uploads a snapshot without deleting
local files, gated on `checkpointInterval >= 0` — **default -1, so it never
runs** — and failures are swallowed (best-effort try/catch). The only other
checkpoint is a pre-destroy safety checkpoint inside the session manager's
dehydrate, which protects against `destroy()` wedging, not against crashes.

### 2.5 What actually holds affinity

The GUID is only as sticky as the duroxide lease behind it. A key with no
activity for ~5.5 min unpins, after which the *same GUID* is claimable by any
worker. The orchestration is never told. Two consequences:

- `wait_on_worker` preserves the GUID across a long wait, but for any wait
  beyond ~5.5 min the wake-up `runTurn` lands on an arbitrary worker — which
  has no local files. Preserved affinity on long waits is theater.
- `dehydrateForNextTurn` itself can land on a worker without files (owner
  died, lease expired). The dehydrate activity then returns a `lossyHandoff`
  result (lifecycle.ts:170): the orchestration sets `needsHydration = false`
  — *nothing was stored* — and the next turn silently fresh-replays. State
  is lost without any crash at turn time.

### 2.6 Cost profile (measured, waldemort fleet)

Every idle fire and every >29 s wait is a full tar round trip: ~250–320
dehydrate/hydrate pairs and 2.3–6.2 GB/day of blob ingress on a steady day;
~1.8–2.9k pairs and ~14 GB on a rollout day. On the turn-latency path, a real
23.6 MB watcher tar costs 763 ms to dehydrate and 112 ms + unpack to hydrate
(medians, in-pod). Details in the store doc.

### 2.7 Gaps

- **G1 — Durability gap.** State is durable only at dehydrate. A worker crash
  mid-turn, during a live wait, or inside the 60 s idle window loses
  everything since the previous dehydrate. Deploys amplify this.
- **G2 — Lossy recovery despite existing snapshots.** The missing-state path
  in `runTurn` fresh-replays instead of hydrating from the store, because the
  orchestration believes `needsHydration = false` and the activity layer
  never checks the store on its own.
- **G3 — Affinity theater past ~5.5 min.** Preserved GUIDs outlive their
  duroxide lease silently (§2.5).
- **G4 — No staleness detection.** `getOrCreate` trusts whatever local files
  it finds. If a preserved key unpins, another worker serves turns, and the
  original worker later reclaims the key, it resumes *stale* files — silent
  state regression. Rotation-by-default masks this today; long
  `wait_on_worker` waits open it.
- **G5 — Maximal churn.** Rotate-by-default + 29 s threshold + 60 s idle
  timer means the fleet pays a full tar cycle per watcher wake and per
  interactive lull, even when the same warm worker would have served the next
  turn. Plus a per-cycle LLM prompt tax (§2.3).
- **G6 — No ordering primitive.** Snapshot metadata carries a content sha but
  no version: nothing can tell "local files are behind the store" from
  "ahead of the store," and blob writes are last-writer-wins.
- **G7 — Shutdown is a crash with extra steps.** The container entrypoint's
  SIGTERM handler calls `worker.stop()`, not the existing
  `gracefulShutdown()`: the duroxide runtime gets
  `PILOTSWARM_WORKER_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT_MS` (default **5 s**) to finish, then
  every in-flight task is aborted, and held sessions are not dehydrated on
  the way down. The worker Deployment sets no `terminationGracePeriodSeconds`
  (k8s default 30 s) and no preStop hook. Any turn longer than 5 s dies
  mid-flight on every deploy — each one an instance of G1.

---

## 3. New protocol

Four principles, each fixing a class of gaps:

- **P1 — Durable at every turn boundary.** Checkpoint is part of turn commit,
  not an optional interval. (G1)
- **P2 — Warm by default.** Local files, the live SDK session, and the
  affinity GUID survive waits and idle windows up to a hold window; releasing
  is the exception. (G5, G3)
- **P3 — The store is the versioned source of truth; local state is a
  cache.** Workers self-validate against an expected version carried in
  activity inputs, and may drop their cache at any time without coordination.
  (G2, G4, G6)
- **P4 — Dehydrate = release.** It stops being the durability mechanism
  (checkpoint is) and becomes "free the worker."
- **P5 — One session activity.** Every interaction with worker-local session
  state lives inside `runTurn`'s preamble and postamble. The orchestration
  never schedules a second session activity whose correctness depends on
  landing where a previous one did — that dependency is the root of the
  whole `needsHydration`-desync bug class (G2, §2.5's lossyHandoff). (G2,
  G4)

### 3.1 Store contract (the protocol's half of the interface)

The store gains a **monotonic per-session version** and compare-and-swap
writes. (Implementation — PG schema, blob ETag fallback — belongs to the
store doc; the protocol only needs these semantics.)

```
checkpoint(sessionId, {expectedVersion, turnKey?, resultMeta?})
        → {version, contentHash}
    Persist the tar iff stored version == expectedVersion; new version =
    expectedVersion + 1. turnKey (execution id + turn index) and a bounded
    resultMeta are stored alongside the tar. On CAS mismatch the store
    returns the stored {version, turnKey} so a retrying writer can tell
    "my prior attempt already committed" (same turnKey — idempotent success)
    from "another execution advanced the session" (split-brain fence — loud
    failure).

hydrate(sessionId, {localVersion?}) → {status:"warm"}
                                    | {status:"hydrated", version}
                                    | {status:"empty"}
    If localVersion equals the stored version, transfer nothing ("warm").
    Otherwise fetch + unpack and report the version now on disk.

contentHash: integrity check on hydrate, and an optional divergence
    assertion at eviction time (§3.4). Release/eviction never writes.
```

The worker records the version in a marker file inside the session dir
(e.g. `.snapshot-version`), written on every successful checkpoint and
hydrate. That marker is the local half of every comparison below. The sha
survives only for integrity checks and drain-time no-op elision — **ordering
is the version's job** (G6).

### 3.2 Atomic turn commit (replaces the interval checkpoint)

A tempting design is a separate `checkpoint` activity scheduled after
`runTurn`. It has a fatal window: the turn's completion is durable in
duroxide history (and its output already delivered to the user) while the
post-turn state exists only on one worker's disk. A crash there strands v_N
forever — the checkpoint retry lands on a worker with no files and cannot
manufacture it (§3.7, W2). And any pair of session activities separated by a
possible lease migration re-creates the coordination flaw of §2.5: the
orchestration carrying beliefs about worker-local disk (`needsHydration`,
`lastLiveSessionAction`) that reality can silently invalidate. So, per P5,
the *entire* lifecycle folds into one activity:

```
runTurn activity:
  preamble  (idempotent; read-only against the store — §3.3)
    p1. turn sentinel present?  → local dir untrusted → hydrate clean
    p2. marker == expected?     → warm start, zero store I/O
        else hydrate(sessionId, {localVersion})
        └ store already at expected+1 under this turnKey → prior attempt
          committed: already-committed recovery (below), body never runs
    p3. write the turn sentinel
  body
    b1. execute the LLM turn    (side effects: at-least-once)
  postamble  (the commit — exactly-once)
    c1. tar + compress the session dir
    c2. store.checkpoint(sessionId, {expectedVersion, turnKey, resultMeta})
    c3. update the local version marker
    c4. clear the turn sentinel
    c5. return {result, version}   ← ONE durable activity completion
```

From the orchestration's perspective, turn completion and state durability
are the same event: `state.snapshotVersion = version` is recorded from the
same completion that carries the turn result. No observable state exists in
which the turn "happened" but its snapshot doesn't. The ordering is
crash-safe at every boundary: a crash after c2 but before c3/c4 leaves the
sentinel in place, so the retry distrusts the dirty dir (p1), discovers its
own committed turnKey at expected + 1 (p2), and takes the recovery path
below — duplication resolved to idempotent success, never re-execution.

**Already-committed recovery.** When the preamble finds the store at
expected + 1 under its *own* turnKey, this turn already ran to completion
somewhere: the previous attempt crashed after its CAS landed but before
duroxide recorded the activity completion — or a lock-expiry retry raced a
still-running attempt, in which case both bodies execute and the CAS
arbitrates (first commit wins; the loser's CAS mismatch carries the same
turnKey). Either way the retry must **restore, not replay**:

```
  r1. hydrate the committed v+1 over whatever is local
      (nothing, on a different worker; a dirty sentinel'd dir on the same)
  r2. write the marker (v+1), clear the sentinel
  r3. return the stored {resultMeta, version} as this attempt's result
      — the LLM is never invoked
```

Post-conditions are identical to the turn having completed normally on this
worker: files warm at v+1, no sentinel, and the orchestration records the
same `{result, version}` it would have received from the first attempt. The
session gets loaded; the turn does not get replayed. (The turn's
user-visible output needs no re-delivery either — the body's CMS events
were recorded by the first attempt, deduped by `(turnKey, seq)` per §3.7
W1.) Skipping r1 and returning bare-handed would also be *correct* under
P3 — the next turn's preamble would hydrate — but it leaves a known-dirty
dir behind and a cold session; since the dirty state must be cleaned anyway,
restoring the committed state (~77 ms measured) is the better exit.

**What this retires.** Of today's session-scoped activities (`runTurn`,
`hydrateSession`, `checkpointSession`, `dehydrateSession`,
`needsHydrationSession`, `destroySession`, `abortTurn`), the new protocol
schedules exactly one for session state: `runTurn`. `hydrateSession` and
`checkpointSession` become the preamble and postamble; `dehydrateSession`
has nothing left to persist (every turn is committed) and its cleanup role
moves to worker-autonomous eviction (§3.4); `needsHydrationSession` — an
activity that exists to ask a worker what it has on disk — is the purest
form of the coordination smell and disappears outright. Two survivors, by
design: `abortTurn` is not state coordination — it is a concurrent
interrupt signal to a running body, carries no disk dependence, and gets
*more* reliable under warm holds (the session stays pinned longer); and
`destroySession` remains as best-effort terminal cleanup whose loss costs
nothing (an undelivered destroy just means the cache evicts the files
later).

Cost: measured 140 ms on a 23.6 MB session dir with the PG store (whole-file
brotli-4), added to the tail of each turn — versus a 763 ms dehydrate +
112 ms hydrate per wake today. Coupling: a store outage now fails turns
loudly (with the turn's own retry policy) instead of accumulating silently
undurable state; today's dehydrate path already had this coupling.

### 3.3 runTurn self-validation (lossy → lossless)

`runTurn`'s input gains `expectedSnapshotVersion`, sourced deterministically
from orchestration state. The activity also maintains a **turn sentinel** — a
file (e.g. `.turn-in-progress`) written at turn start and removed only by
step 4 of the commit — marking the local dir as mid-mutation. On activity
start:

1. **Sentinel present** → a prior attempt died mid-turn *on this worker*.
   The local dir is dirty (half a turn applied) even though its marker still
   reads the pre-turn version — a naive marker check would warm-start on
   corrupt state. Treat local as untrusted → hydrate clean.
2. **Marker == expected, no sentinel** → warm start. Zero store I/O — the
   common case costs nothing new.
3. **Marker missing or ≠ expected** (lease migrated, pod restarted, stale
   files) → `hydrate(sessionId, {localVersion})`: fetch exactly the expected
   state, overwrite local. Lossless. If the store reports
   expectedVersion + 1 under this turn's own turnKey, the previous attempt
   already committed — take the already-committed recovery (§3.2): hydrate
   the committed state, return its stored result, never invoke the LLM.
4. **Store empty** → today's fresh-session replay, now confined to sessions
   that have never committed a turn.

Hydrate itself must be crash-atomic: unpack into a temp directory and
`rename()` it into place, writing the version marker last, so a crash
mid-hydrate can never leave a plausible-looking session dir — the next
attempt sees either the old dir (marker mismatch → re-hydrate) or the
complete new one. Every preamble step is a read against the store, so the
whole preamble is trivially re-runnable.

This one check closes G2 and G4 simultaneously: a stale worker can only
hydrate *forward*, never resume backward, and its stray late checkpoint (from
an obsolete execution) fails CAS at the store. Duroxide's own sessions spec
prescribes exactly this shape — the activity detects missing process-local
state and the application rehydrates — which v1.0.56 approximates with the
lossy path; this makes it the real thing.

### 3.4 Wait policy: three tiers

`planWaitHandling` keeps its shape; the middle tier changes meaning.

| Tier | Window | Action |
|---|---|---|
| 1 — live | ≤ `dehydrateThreshold` (29 s) | Unchanged: orchestration timer, everything stays hot. |
| 2 — **checkpoint-hold** | 29 s → `holdWindow` (default 30 min) | **No dehydrate.** State is already durable from turn commit. Local files, SDK session, and GUID all kept; `needsHydration = false`. On wake, `runTurn` fires directly on the same GUID → same worker, warm start. Self-validation (§3.3) covers the case where the lease was lost anyway. |
| 3 — release | > `holdWindow`, drain | **Rotate the GUID — a pure orchestration-state change, no activity at all.** Nothing needs uploading (every completed turn is committed) and nothing needs telling the old worker: its copy is a cache (P3) that its own eviction reclaims. The next event hydrates wherever duroxide places the new key. |

The **idle timer becomes the hold window**: its duration changes from 60 s to
`holdWindow`, and it fires a *rotation*, not a dehydrate-upload. The existing
cancel-on-activity machinery (queue.ts:365) already implements the "any
session activity resets the idle clock" rule — each turn re-arms the timer.

**Worker-side eviction** is the physical half of release, and it is
autonomous: the worker runs its own per-session idle clock (default
`holdWindow` + margin, aligned with the duroxide lease decay) and evicts —
destroy in-memory session, delete local dir — without telling anyone. P5
means there is no release activity to coordinate with; P3 means evicting
early is always safe (the next `runTurn` self-validates and hydrates). An
evicting worker MAY compare its local sha against the stored `contentHash`
first, purely as a divergence assertion for telemetry — release never
writes.

`wait_on_worker` becomes redundant below `holdWindow` (holding is the
default) and remains ineffective above it by design (tier 3 rotates). It is
kept as an accepted no-op for prompt compatibility and can be retired from
the tool surface later.

The rehydration prompt wrapper (§2.3) now only appears when a session
genuinely moved — a real signal instead of routine noise.

### 3.5 Duroxide alignment

The protocol holds affinity at the app layer; the duroxide lease must outlive
it or the hold is fiction (G3):

- **`sessionIdleTimeoutMs`: 300 000 → `holdWindow` + margin** (35 min for a
  30 min hold). Cheap: idle renewal is one batched heartbeat UPDATE per
  runtime, and crash reclaim is governed by the *lock* timeout, which does
  not change.
- **`maxSessionsPerRuntime`: 10 → sized to worker memory/disk.** A warm hold
  costs the session dir on disk plus the SDK session in memory; ~50 is a
  reasonable starting point for current pods, with telemetry to tune.
- **Lock timeout stays 30 s** (not tunable from Node, and shouldn't change):
  long affinity for healthy workers, ≤30 s failover for dead ones.
- **`workerNodeId` unchanged** (already one identity per pod). A restarted
  pod that reclaims its old keys holds no files — self-validation hydrates.

### 3.6 The protocol in action

**Warm interactive turn (common case).** User message → `runTurn(expected v9)`
on GUID *g* → no sentinel, marker reads 9 → warm start → turn runs and
commits CAS 9→10 in its tail → idle-hold re-armed. Store I/O: one compressed
write (~0.5 MB measured).

**Watcher cron cycle (10 min wait, tier 2).** Turn commits v→v+1 → hold
with a 600 s timer → fire → `runTurn(v+1)` on the same GUID, same worker,
warm. Per cycle: one write, zero reads, zero tar/untar, zero prompt tax.
Today the same cycle is: dehydrate (upload + local delete) → GUID rotation →
hydrate (download + unpack) → resume-context prompt wrapper.

**Worker crash mid-hold.** Heartbeats stop → duroxide reclaims the key in
≤30 s → next event routes `runTurn(v10)` to worker B → marker missing →
hydrate v10 → lossless resume. Nothing is lost: every completed turn was
committed. Crashes *mid-turn* and *post-CAS* are walked through in §3.7
(W1/W2).

**Deploy.** SIGTERM triggers the drain sequence (§3.8): in-flight turns
finish and commit, warm sessions are released without uploads, leases lapse.
New pods hydrate on demand at the exact committed version. No dehydrate
storm on the way down (state was already durable — today's rollout days move
~14 GB), and no lossy replays (G1, G7 closed). Correctness never depends on
the drain: a pod killed outright is just the crash case above.

**Stale worker (the regression case).** Worker A held files at v5; its lease
lapsed; worker B served turns to v9; the GUID later routes back to A.
`runTurn(expected 9)` → marker 5 → hydrate 9 → overwrite. If A had a stray
checkpoint queued from the old execution, its CAS on `expectedVersion 5`
fails against the stored 9. Both directions of G4 are closed.

**Long idle.** The hold-window timer fires → the orchestration rotates the
GUID and does nothing else — no activity, no store I/O. The old worker's
copy ages out under its own eviction clock. The session costs nothing
anywhere until the next event, which hydrates on any worker.

**Worker under pressure (eviction).** Because local state is a cache (P3), a
worker may destroy + delete any held session *without telling the
orchestration*: the next `runTurn` self-validates and hydrates. LRU eviction
becomes a purely local decision — no protocol message exists for it because
none is needed.

### 3.7 Data-loss and duplication windows, honestly

The new protocol does not make loss impossible; it makes the windows
enumerable. Calling each one out:

**W1 — Mid-turn crash: side effects are at-least-once.** A turn is not a
transaction. By the time a worker dies mid-turn, the LLM may already have
acted — tool calls executed, CMS events recorded, messages sent, commits
pushed — but nothing advanced the version: the commit (§3.2) never ran, so
neither the local marker nor the store moved past v_N−1. The retry
re-executes the turn from its durable input on top of clean v_N−1 state.
*Session state* rewinds precisely; *the world* does not. Recovery differs by
where the retry lands:

- **Different worker:** no local files → hydrate v_N−1 → clean re-execution.
  The only artifact of the first attempt is its external side effects,
  possibly now duplicated.
- **Same worker** (process survived and duroxide retries locally, or the pod
  restarted with disk intact under the same `workerNodeId`): the local dir
  is **dirty** — mutated by the half-executed turn — while the marker still
  reads v_N−1. Without protection this warm-starts on half-applied state,
  which is worse than either losing or duplicating the turn. The turn
  sentinel (§3.3 rule 1) makes this case detect as untrusted and hydrate
  clean v_N−1, converging with the different-worker path.

How idempotent can the body realistically get? In-system side effects can
be deduplicated: CMS session events emitted during the turn can carry a
`(turnKey, seq)` idempotency key (`ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`), so a
re-executed turn never double-records user-visible events. External tool
effects (emails, pushes, API calls) remain at-least-once — inherent to
durable-execution retry and unchanged from today; tools with hard external
effects need their own idempotency, out of scope here. The commit itself is
exactly-once (turnKey CAS), which bounds the blast radius of a retry to
"the world may see a tool action twice," never "the session forgets or
double-applies a turn."

**W2 — Between turn end and state commit.** The reason §3.2 is atomic. In a
two-activity design (runTurn, then checkpoint) there is a window where the
turn's completion is durable — the user has seen its output — but v_N lives
only on the dead worker's disk; a checkpoint retry elsewhere finds no files
and cannot manufacture it. The session would permanently forget a turn whose
output was delivered: user-visible amnesia, the worst loss mode. Folding the
CAS into the `runTurn` activity removes the window structurally — no durable
"turn completed" record can exist without its snapshot. The residual case, a
crash between the CAS landing and duroxide recording the activity
completion, is duplication-shaped, not loss-shaped, and the
already-committed recovery (§3.2) resolves it — restore the committed
state, return the stored result — instead of re-running.

**W3 — Sessions that never committed.** A crash during the very first turn
finds the store empty and falls back to fresh-session replay — W1 with
nothing to hydrate. Today's lossy path survives only here, confined to
turn #1.

**W4 — Store unavailable at commit time.** The commit retries with the turn;
a prolonged store outage fails turns loudly rather than accumulating
silently undurable state. Deliberate trade: the store joins the CMS on the
critical path.

Gone entirely, relative to §2.7: loss of committed turns on crash (G1),
fresh replays despite existing snapshots (G2), and silent stale resumes
(G4).

### 3.8 Graceful drain

Today's shutdown is gap G7: `stop()` gives in-flight turns 5 s, then aborts
them, and never releases sessions. The replacement sequence, on SIGTERM from
the platform (AKS pod termination, scale-down, node maintenance):

```
1. Stop fetching     runtime.shutdown(drainBudgetMs) sets duroxide's
                     shutdown flag; dispatch slots finish their current
                     item and claim nothing new.
2. Finish in-flight  Running turns run to completion; their atomic
                     commits land inside the activity (§3.2).
3. Evict all         Purely local: destroy in-memory sessions, delete
                     session dirs. No store I/O — every completed turn is
                     already committed (optional sha assertions, §3.4).
4. Exit              Anything still leased lapses within ≤30 s.
```

Wiring: the container entrypoint's SIGTERM handler switches from `stop()` to
`gracefulShutdown()`, whose dehydrate-everything body becomes
release-everything under P4; `PILOTSWARM_WORKER_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT_MS` becomes
the drain budget, **default 60 s** — long enough to let the majority of
turns complete, short enough to keep rollouts brisk (and, until the
upstream early-exit fix lands, 60 s is also the unconditional wall-clock
cost per pod). Turns that outlive the budget are aborted into W1: safe,
retried post-deploy, at worst duplicating their external side effects.
`terminationGracePeriodSeconds` on the worker Deployment must exceed the
budget — 90 s (k8s default is 30 s — today the platform would kill the pod
before a long turn finished even if the app waited).

If the budget expires, duroxide aborts the stragglers — crash semantics,
which under this protocol are lossless for every committed turn; the aborted
turn itself is W1. **Graceful drain is therefore a latency and
side-effect-duplication optimization, not a correctness requirement** — the
safety story never depends on the platform honoring its grace period.

**What duroxide exposes today** is one fused primitive,
`shutdown(timeoutMs)`, whose graceful path is genuinely early-quiescing on
the work side but not on the caller side:

- *The machinery drains early.* Each dispatcher slot checks the shutdown
  flag at the top of its loop and exits immediately
  (`dispatchers/worker.rs:210`); the min-poll-interval sleep is skipped
  once the flag is set (`worker.rs:256`). In-flight items are awaited, not
  aborted: a slot finishes its current activity, then exits. Work stops as
  fast as it can, with no lingering polls.
- *The call does not return early.* `Runtime::shutdown` sets the flag and
  then does an unconditional `tokio::time::sleep(timeout_ms)`
  (`runtime/mod.rs:1029`) before sweeping up — it never awaits the join
  handles, so the caller blocks for the full budget even when every
  dispatcher exited in the first 50 ms. The post-sleep abort sweep only
  bites tasks still running past the budget. `shutdown(0)` is an
  immediate abort-all.

So the drain sequence above is already safe and prompt *for the work*; the
only defect is deploy wall-clock — the pod waits the full drain budget
before exiting regardless. The upstream fix is correspondingly tiny:
replace the fixed sleep with awaiting the join handles under a timeout
(`tokio::time::timeout(budget, join_all(joins))`, then abort leftovers) —
backward compatible, a few lines in `Runtime::shutdown`, nothing needed in
the node binding.

### 3.9 Delta summary

| Event | Today (1.0.56) | New |
|---|---|---|
| Turn completes | Nothing durable (`checkpointInterval = -1`) | Atomic in-activity commit — one CAS write |
| Wait ≤ 29 s | Live | Live (unchanged) |
| Wait 29 s – 30 min | Dehydrate + rotate; hydrate on fire | Hold: zero store I/O |
| Interactive lull | Dehydrate 60 s after last turn | Hold up to 30 min, then GUID rotation (no activity, no I/O) |
| Worker crash | Lossy fresh replay | Hydrate last turn commit — lossless (W1: side effects at-least-once) |
| In-flight turn at deploy | Aborted after 5 s → lossy | Runs to completion within drain budget |
| Deploy | Mass dehydrate/hydrate churn + lossy handoffs | Drain: commit + release; stragglers ≤30 s reclaim |
| `wait_on_worker` > 5 min | Silent affinity loss (G3) | Real hold ≤ 30 min via raised idle timeout |
| Stale local files | Silently resumed (G4) | Version mismatch → hydrate forward |
| Dirty files after mid-turn crash | Silently resumed | Turn sentinel → hydrate clean |

I/O envelope for the waldemort watcher fleet: today ~3.7 GB/day of ingress
from three active watchers; under the new protocol, one compressed write per
turn (~0.5 MB × ~300 turns/day ≈ **150 MB/day**) and near-zero reads. The PG
store's phase-1 numbers assume exactly this write pattern.

### 3.10 Configuration

| Knob | Layer | Today | New |
|---|---|---|---|
| `dehydrateThreshold` | orchestration input | 29 s | Kept as the tier-1/tier-2 boundary (wait mechanics only; no storage meaning) |
| `idleTimeout` | orchestration input | 60 s | Becomes `holdWindow`; default 1800 s; reset on any session activity |
| `checkpointInterval` | orchestration input | -1 (off) | Retired — the commit lives inside `runTurn` |
| `sessionIdleTimeoutMs` | duroxide runtime | 300 000 | `holdWindow` + margin (e.g. 2 100 000) |
| `maxSessionsPerRuntime` | duroxide runtime | 10 | Sized to memory (~50, telemetry-tuned) |
| session lock timeout | duroxide (fixed) | 30 s | Unchanged — the crash-reclaim bound |
| worker session eviction clock | worker-local (new) | n/a (dehydrate deletes) | `holdWindow` + margin, autonomous (§3.4) |
| `PILOTSWARM_WORKER_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT_MS` | worker env | 5 000 | Drain budget: 60 000 |
| `terminationGracePeriodSeconds` | k8s worker Deployment | unset (30 s) | 90 (drain budget + margin) |
| SIGTERM handler | container entrypoint | `stop()` — aborts in-flight | `gracefulShutdown()` — drain (§3.8) |

### 3.11 Rollout

1. **Store first.** Version/CAS contract ships in the store layer
   (blob: metadata + ETag CAS; PG: native). Legacy version-less writes
   (from 1.0.56 executions' dehydrates) are accepted as unconditional
   writes that bump the version — old and new writers coexist.
2. **Workers next.** Activity-side self-validation, sentinel/marker
   handling, and the drain entrypoint switch (§3.8) are
   orchestration-version-agnostic; a worker that receives no
   `expectedSnapshotVersion` behaves exactly as today.
3. **Orchestration last**, as **1.0.57** in the versioned registry. Running
   executions keep 1.0.56 semantics until they complete; new sessions get
   the new protocol. No migration step, no coordination window.

### 3.12 Open questions

- **Whale commits.** A 150 MB session dir makes the per-turn commit
  expensive; answers are tar excludes (audit what bloats those workspaces)
  and the store's phase-2 CDC chunking, which turns each commit into a
  delta. The protocol is unchanged either way.
- **`resultMeta` size.** Turn results can be large (long assistant replies);
  the store's meta column needs a cap, with the retry path falling back to a
  synthetic "turn was committed by a prior attempt" result when truncated —
  or results stay out of the store entirely and the retry path re-delivers
  only status, not content. Needs a decision at implementation time.
- **Drain budget calibration.** 60 s is chosen to catch the majority of
  turns; stragglers abort into W1 (safe — duplicated side effects at
  worst). A turn-duration histogram from production would confirm the
  coverage and whether watcher-heavy fleets want a different number; the
  knob is per-worker either way.
- **Hold-window sizing.** 30 min is a guess balancing worker memory against
  hydrate frequency; `session.hydrated` event rates before/after will show
  whether it should be per-agent (watchers vs interactive) rather than
  global.

## 4. Test plan

The protocol's correctness claims are mostly claims about *crash timing*,
which wall-clock tests cannot hit reliably. The plan therefore centers on
**named fault points**: a tiny helper (`await faultPoint("c2.after-cas")`)
compiled into the activity code at every protocol boundary, a no-op unless
`PILOTSWARM_FAULT_INJECT` names it — in which case it kills the process
(`process.exit(137)`) or stalls (`SIGSTOP`-equivalent delay) at exactly that
point. Faults are deterministic code locations, never sleeps.

### 4.1 Store contract conformance (unit, per backend)

One reusable suite run against `PgSessionStateStore`, the Azure provider,
and `FilesystemSessionStore` — the contract is the protocol's foundation
and all three must agree:

- Create → version 1; commit at `expectedVersion` → exactly +1; version
  sequence gap-free and monotonic.
- CAS mismatch with a foreign turnKey → loud failure carrying the stored
  `{version, turnKey}`.
- Commit retry with own turnKey at expected + 1 → idempotent success
  returning the stored `resultMeta`.
- `hydrate({localVersion})` equal → `warm` with zero body transfer
  (instrumented); behind → `hydrated` with byte-exact content (sha).
- Empty store → `empty`; legacy version-less write → unconditional +
  version bump.
- **Race:** N concurrent commits at the same `expectedVersion` → exactly
  one winner; every loser sees the winner's `{version, turnKey}`. (PG:
  parallel transactions; blob: interleaved HEAD/PUT with forced 412
  retries.)
- `resultMeta` over the size cap → truncation fallback, blob's ~8 KB
  metadata bound included.

### 4.2 Activity preamble/postamble (in-process, stubbed body)

`runTurn` wrapper against a real session dir + real store, with the LLM
body replaced by a scripted mutation — asserting each §3.2/§3.3 rule:

- Warm start: marker match, no sentinel → zero store calls, body runs.
- Marker mismatch/missing → hydrate exact version, then body.
- Sentinel present, store at expected → local discarded, clean hydrate,
  body re-runs (W1).
- Sentinel present, store at expected + 1 with own turnKey →
  already-committed recovery: **body provably not invoked**, result equals
  stored, dir ends at v+1 with sentinel cleared.
- Hydrate atomicity: fault mid-unpack → real dir untouched or absent,
  never half-written; retry succeeds.
- Sentinel ordering: created after preamble, removed only after c3.

### 4.3 Orchestration 1.0.57 (deterministic replay)

- Wait tiers: ≤29 s live; 29 s–holdWindow → GUID unchanged, no activity
  scheduled, `needsHydration` never set; >holdWindow → rotation and
  nothing else.
- Idle timer resets on prompt within the window (existing cancel machinery).
- `snapshotVersion` threading: recorded from each turn's result, present in
  the next turn's input, stable under history replay.
- Mixed registry: a 1.0.56 execution replays to completion unchanged
  alongside 1.0.57 sessions.

### 4.4 Failure injection (crash matrix)

Harness: local starter compose with **two workers** (distinct
`workerNodeId`), scripted prompts, faults armed per turn. After every
scenario the same oracle runs:

- **I1** — store version sequence gap-free; final content sha matches a
  reference replay.
- **I2** — zero `session.lossy_handoff` events while the store is
  non-empty.
- **I3** — every user prompt answered exactly once in CMS (turnKey/seq
  dedup holds).
- **I4** — no session dir ever both sentinel-free and behind the store's
  committed sha at rest.
- **I5** — the session converges: next prompt after recovery produces a
  normal turn.

| Fault | Point | Expected recovery |
|---|---|---|
| F1 | mid-body (crashing stub tool) | retry re-executes on clean v_N−1; same worker must take sentinel path |
| F2 | after tar, before CAS (c1→c2) | identical to F1 — nothing committed |
| F3 | after CAS, before marker (c2→c3) | already-committed recovery; LLM not invoked |
| F4 | after marker, before sentinel clear (c3→c4) | same as F3 (sentinel forces distrust, store says committed) |
| F5 | after c5, before duroxide records completion (kill on ack) | duroxide retries; already-committed recovery |
| F6 | mid-hydrate unpack | atomic rename holds; retry hydrates |
| F7 | SIGTERM with drain budget < turn length | turn aborted → F1 semantics post-deploy |
| F8 | SIGSTOP > lock timeout mid-turn, then resume | second worker claims retry, both bodies race, CAS arbitrates; loser adopts winner's result |

Plus a **chaos soak**: N-turn conversation, one random fault point armed
per turn, both workers eligible — oracle after every turn. This is the test
that earns the "lossless" claim.

### 4.5 Multi-worker lifecycle scenarios

- Warm affinity: turn on A → tier-2 wait → wake lands on A with zero
  hydrates (trace-asserted).
- Migration: kill A mid-hold → next turn on B at the committed version, no
  lossy event.
- Stale worker (G4): freeze A holding v5 files, advance to v9 via B, route
  the key back to A → A hydrates forward, never resumes v5.
- Hold-window expiry → rotation → next turn hydrates wherever placed.
- Eviction under pressure (tiny eviction clock) → invisible to the
  orchestration, next turn hydrates.
- Rolling deploy of a mixed 1.0.56/1.0.57 fleet: legacy dehydrates
  interleave with commits, version stays monotonic, zero lossy events.

### 4.6 Regression gates

- Commit overhead p50/p95 vs the 140 ms baseline (23.6 MB dir, PG).
- Watcher steady state: exactly one store write per cycle, zero reads.
- `session.hydrated` event rate drops to migration-only.
- A full rollout produces zero `session.lossy_handoff` events (today's
  rollout days produce them routinely — this is the headline gate).
