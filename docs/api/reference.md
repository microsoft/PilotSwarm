# PilotSwarm Web API Reference

The Web API is the supported way to talk to a PilotSwarm deployment: a
versioned HTTP + WebSocket surface hosted by the portal server at `/api/v1`
and `/api/v1/ws`. Clients need exactly one thing — the deployment URL — and
never hold database or storage credentials.

Most callers should use a higher-level client rather than raw HTTP:

- **SDK (Node):** `new PilotSwarmClient({ apiUrl })` / `new PilotSwarmManagementClient({ apiUrl })`
- **Browser / isomorphic:** [`pilotswarm-sdk/api`](../../packages/sdk/api/README.md)
- **TUI:** `npx pilotswarm remote --api-url <url>`

To read and write the **Facts** and **Graph** surfaces (below) from an SDK app as
`FactStore` / `GraphStore` instances rather than raw HTTP, see the
[Facts & Graph SDK guide](../developer/building/facts-and-graph.md).

The contract's source of truth is the operations table in
[`packages/sdk/api/src/protocol.js`](../../packages/sdk/api/src/protocol.js) —
the portal server generates its routes from it, so this document cannot be
more current than that file. The operation tables below are generated from it.

## Conventions

- **Envelope:** every JSON operation responds `{ "ok": true, "result": … }` or
  `{ "ok": false, "error": { "code", "message" } }`.
- **Statuses:** `400` invalid request · `401` missing/invalid token ·
  `403` authenticated but not admitted (the `message` carries the authz
  reason) · `404` not found · `500` unexpected · plus operation-specific
  errors surfaced with their own codes.
- **Query types:** `boolean` params take `true`/`false`; `json` params take
  URL-encoded JSON (e.g. the paging `cursor`); dates are ISO 8601 strings.
- **Body:** JSON, limit 2 MB (binary artifact uploads ride base64 within it).

## Auth

Auth mode is discovered from the public `GET /api/v1/auth/config`
(`{ enabled, provider, client: { clientId, authority, redirectUri } | null }`).

- **`none`** — no token; every caller shares the synthetic
  `none/unknown` principal.
- **`entra`** — send `Authorization: Bearer <token>` with a v2 access token
  for scope `<clientId>/.default`. Browsers use MSAL; the TUI uses the
  interactive browser flow / auth code + PKCE (`pilotswarm auth login`; `--device-code` for headless hosts). WebSocket upgrades accept the
  bearer header or the subprotocol list `["access_token", <token>]` and
  close `4401`/`4403` on failure.
- **`proxy`** — the identity-aware front door authenticates the user and adds
  a signed assertion or trusted identity headers to each HTTP and WebSocket
  request. Browser clients send no bearer token directly; discovery returns
  `client: null`. Direct origin access must be blocked when unsigned header
  mode is enabled.

Admission follows the portal's authorization engine (app roles →
email allowlists → `PORTAL_AUTHZ_DEFAULT_ROLE`); a `403` body carries the
engine's reason.

## Bespoke routes

| Route | Auth | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /api/v1/health` | public | `{ ok, started, mode, apiVersion }` — readiness probe target |
| `GET /api/v1/auth/config` | public | Auth provider discovery (see above) |
| `GET /api/v1/auth/me` | authed | `{ principal, authorization }` for the caller |
| `GET /api/v1/bootstrap` | authed | Mode, worker count, log config, models, creatable agents, session policy, auth context |
| `GET /api/v1/sessions/:sessionId/artifacts/:filename/download` | authed | Binary artifact stream (`Content-Disposition: attachment`) |
| `GET /api/v1/agent-packages/:name/download` | authed | Full SHA-verified package tarball; optional `semver`, `scope`, and admin owner selector query params |

## Streaming: `WS /api/v1/ws`

```text
client -> server: subscribeSession { sessionId } | unsubscribeSession { sessionId }
                  | subscribeLive { sessionId, topics[] } | unsubscribeLive { sessionId }
                  | subscribeLogs {} | unsubscribeLogs {}
server -> client: ready | subscribedSession { sessionId } | sessionEvent { sessionId, event }
                  | subscribedLive { sessionId, topics[] }
                  | live { sessionId, topic, seq, kind, data?, updatedAt? }
                  | subscribedLogs | logEntry { entry } | error { scope, sessionId?, error }
```

WebSocket delivery is an acceleration path; correctness comes from replay —
after a reconnect, catch up with
`GET /api/v1/management/sessions/:sessionId/events?afterSeq=…`. The log tail
is live-only (no history, no catch-up). Generic live topics are ephemeral
last-value state: reconnecting clients receive a retained snapshot from
`getLive` before subsequent notifications. They do not enter session history.

`kind` is `snapshot`, `patch`, `signal`, or `unavailable` (release cached
state and its sequence). Clients ignore stale snapshots, refetch on patch
gaps, and replay durable events independently. Topic subscriptions are limited
to 16 per session; live publishing is server-only. The optional `turn` topic
carries `phase`, `streamId`, message/reasoning IDs and cumulative text, plus
`truncated: true` when a preview reaches its limit. An idle applies only to
its stream. See [live-plane architecture](../architecture/live-plane.md).

## Operations

Operations tagged **[admin]** require the `admin` role. Session operations are
also authorized by access class: read/write may be delegated by visibility or
targeted grants; manage/destroy/share remain owner/admin only. Inaccessible
sessions return not-found to avoid an existence oracle.

### Sessions

| Operation | Route | Parameters | Summary |
|---|---|---|---|
| listSessions | `GET /api/v1/sessions` | — | List session summaries. |
| createSession | `POST /api/v1/sessions` | model (body), reasoningEffort (body), contextTier (body), groupId (body), visibility (body) | Create a session. Owner is the authenticated principal; visibility defaults to the deployment default. `groupId` is an initial placement into one of **your** groups — `403` if the group is missing or not yours. |
| createSessionForAgent | `POST /api/v1/sessions/for-agent` | agentName (body), model (body), reasoningEffort (body), contextTier (body), title (body), splash (body), initialPrompt (body), groupId (body), visibility (body) | Create a session bound to a named agent. Same `groupId` placement rule as createSession. |
| getSession | `GET /api/v1/sessions/:sessionId` | sessionId (path) | Get one session view (live orchestration status). |
| deleteSession | `DELETE /api/v1/sessions/:sessionId` | sessionId (path) | Cancel and soft-delete a session. |
| sendMessage | `POST /api/v1/sessions/:sessionId/messages` | sessionId (path), prompt (body), options (body) | Send a prompt (options: { enqueueOnly?, clientMessageIds? }). |
| sendAnswer | `POST /api/v1/sessions/:sessionId/answers` | sessionId (path), answer (body), options (body) | Answer a pending question. `options.expectedQuestion: { question, iteration? }` binds to the observed `pendingQuestion`; omitted options bind to the current question when enqueued. A stale binding preserves the text as an ordinary message. |
| raiseSignal | `POST /api/v1/sessions/:sessionId/signals/:name` | sessionId/name (path), data/payloadRef/signalId/wake (body, optional) | Queue a typed durable signal; starts a new pending session without a prompt. Requires session write access. |
| getSessionSignalState | `GET /api/v1/sessions/:sessionId/signals` | sessionId (path) | Read pending wait, interruption flag, and buffered metadata, never inline payloads. Requires session read access. |
| sendSessionEvent | `POST /api/v1/sessions/:sessionId/events` | sessionId (path), eventName (body), data (body) | Deprecated wrapper for `raiseSignal(eventName, { data })`, with `wake: false`; not a raw prompt/command channel. |
| cancelPendingMessage | `POST /api/v1/sessions/:sessionId/cancel-pending` | sessionId (path), clientMessageIds (body) | Cancel queued messages by client message ids. |

Session DTOs (`listSessions`, `getSession`, paged management listings) carry
**`viewerGroupId`** — the *caller's own* private group placement for the
session's tree root (`null`/absent on child rows and when the caller has not
placed the tree). The former `groupId` field is **gone** from session DTOs:
group membership is per-viewer state, not a property of the session. See
[Management: session groups](#management-session-groups).

### Durable signals

```typescript
const receipt = await management.raiseSignal(sessionId, "build_ready", {
    data: { build: 7, succeeded: true },
    signalId: "build-7", // reuse for delivery retries
    wake: false,
});
// { signalId, name, raisedAt, status: "queued" }
const state = await management.getSessionSignalState(sessionId);
// { version: 1, pendingWait?, interrupted: boolean, buffered: [...] }
```

The same write is available as `session.raiseSignal(name, options)` in direct
and Web SDK modes, and as MCP `raise_signal`. The HTTP body is the options
object itself, not `{ options: ... }`.

- Names match `[a-z0-9_-]{1,64}`. Inline `data` must be JSON and at most
  **32 KiB in UTF-8** (bounded nesting/field count also applies).
- `payloadRef` is an opaque non-empty reference of at most 1,024
  **JSON-encoded UTF-8 bytes**, including quotes and escapes, without control
  characters. It is **never automatically fetched**.
- Optional `signalId` is 1–128 characters matching
  `[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9._:-]{0,127}`; otherwise the server generates an ID.
  Source/actor identity and `raisedAt` come from the trusted server context,
  never request fields. Signal data cannot alter the session's owner, tools,
  model, or other creation configuration.
- `wake` defaults to `false`. Pre-arrival signals can start a pending session's
  orchestration without a prompt or model turn. A matching durable wait
  consumes a signal; `wake: true` requests an attributed turn even without a
  matching wait. Waits can be indefinite or timed. Initial sends wait up to
  ten seconds for a worker to initialize the execution so its actual version
  can be verified; on timeout no signal is queued. Start may still complete,
  so retry the same signal after upgraded workers are available.
- A queued receipt confirms **enqueue**, not consumption or uniqueness.
  Buffering is bounded to 32 signals; deduplication covers buffered signals
  and the last 128 accepted IDs, not an unlimited exactly-once guarantee.
  Inspect `session.signal_*` events through the existing event APIs for
  lifecycle outcomes.
- Writes refuse deleted, terminal, and service sessions. An execution older
  than **1.0.80**, or one whose version cannot be confirmed, is not a signal
  target: `SIGNALS_UNSUPPORTED` (`409`). Create a new session on upgraded
  workers rather than attempting to feed the legacy decoder.
- Validation failures are `INVALID_SIGNAL` (`400`) or `SIGNAL_TOO_LARGE`
  (`413`); terminal/service conflicts are `SESSION_NOT_ACTIVE` (`409`).

`getSessionSignalState` returns only metadata: `pendingWait` contains
`waitId`, `names`, `reason`, `startedAt`, and an optional absolute `deadline`;
buffered envelopes replace inline `data` with `dataBytes`. Missing state on
a confirmed compatible execution means an empty buffer and no wait.
Unstarted/unknown/legacy executions instead return `SIGNALS_UNSUPPORTED`.
`getSession` and live custom-status reads also expose `signalWait` and
`signalWaitInterrupted`.

Stop cancels a parked signal wait using the **observed wait ID**; a replaced
or already-consumed wait is a no-op. During an active interrupted model turn,
Stop keeps its existing turn-scoped behavior. `StopTurnResult` is unchanged.

Compatibility `session.sendEvent`, `management.sendSessionEvent`, HTTP
`/events`, and MCP `send_session_event` wrap the entire payload as signal
data. A payload such as `{ prompt: "...", type: "cmd", answer: "yes" }` does
not invoke any of those operations. Use `sendMessage`, `sendAnswer`, or
the appropriate management method instead.

On orchestration 1.0.80+, `wait_for_any` exposes `pendingWait.mode: "any"` and
`lastRaceOutcome`: one typed winner (`signal`, `user`, `timeout`, `stop`,
`cancel`) plus durable loser dispositions. See
[durable races](../developer/building/durable-signals.md#race-signals-against-user-input).

### Webhook management

These operations are typed `PilotSwarmManagementClient` methods in direct and
Web API modes. The server stamps the viewer from authentication; never send a
viewer or credential value in the body. An administrator must approve connector
credentials and session-template configuration. Other reads/mutations are
owner-scoped, subject to the configured administrator scope and current grants.

| Operation | Route | Body/query |
|---|---|---|
| createSignalEndpoint | `POST /api/v1/sessions/:sessionId/signal-endpoints/:signalName` | `{ options: { label?, expiresAt?, maxUses?, wake?, hmacSecretRef?, rateLimitPerMinute? } }` |
| listSignalEndpoints | `GET /api/v1/sessions/:sessionId/signal-endpoints` | None; metadata only |
| revokeSignalEndpoint | `DELETE /api/v1/signal-endpoints/:endpointId` | None |
| createWebhookConnector / listWebhookConnectors | `POST` / `GET /api/v1/webhooks/connectors` | Create: `{ input }` |
| updateWebhookConnector / revokeWebhookConnector | `PATCH` / `DELETE /api/v1/webhooks/connectors/:connectorId` | Update: `{ patch: { expectedRevision, ... } }` |
| createWebhookBinding / listWebhookBindings | `POST` / `GET /api/v1/webhooks/bindings` | Create: `{ input }` |
| updateWebhookBinding / revokeWebhookBinding | `PATCH` / `DELETE /api/v1/webhooks/bindings/:bindingId` | Update: `{ patch: { expectedRevision, ... } }` |
| createWebhookSessionTemplate / listWebhookSessionTemplates | `POST` / `GET /api/v1/webhooks/templates` | Create: `{ input }` |
| updateWebhookSessionTemplate / revokeWebhookSessionTemplate | `PATCH` / `DELETE /api/v1/webhooks/templates/:templateId` | Update: `{ patch: { expectedRevision, ... } }` |
| testWebhookBinding | `POST /api/v1/webhooks/bindings/:bindingId/test` | `{ event: <normalized-event> }` |
| listWebhookReceipts | `GET /api/v1/webhooks/receipts` | `query=<URL-encoded JSON>` with `connectorId?`, `endpointId?`, `sessionId?`, `status?`, `before?`, `limit?` |
| getWebhookReceipt | `GET /api/v1/webhooks/receipts/:receiptId` | None |
| replayWebhookReceipt | `POST /api/v1/webhooks/receipts/:receiptId/replay` | `{ confirmed: true }`; explicit confirmation required |
| getWebhookMetrics | `GET /api/v1/webhooks/metrics` | None |
| updateWebhookRetentionPolicy | `PATCH /api/v1/webhooks/retention` | Admin-only `{ patch: { expectedRevision, receiptRetentionDays, replayRetentionDays } }` |

Endpoint creation returns the capability URL/token **once**. Metadata reads
never return them. Connector auth accepts approved references only:
`{mode:"github-hmac-sha256",secretRef}` or
`{mode:"ado-basic",usernameRef,passwordRef}`. Updates carry `expectedRevision`;
conflicts refuse instead of overwriting newer policy. Payloads cannot select
owners, models, agents, namespaces, tools or routing destinations.

External delivery uses separate opt-in `POST /hooks/s/:token` and
`POST /hooks/c/:connectorId` routes, outside portal sign-in but authenticated
by capability/HMAC or provider credentials over trusted HTTPS. Their body is
raw JSON, not the management wrapper above. A `202 {accepted:true}` response
means durable receipt/outbox acceptance, not consumption or model success.
Receipts expose redacted timelines, attempts, duplicate counts and correlation.
Signal and approved prompt consumption both require 1.0.80+. Prompt consumption
means dispatch into a turn, not successful model completion.

See [webhook ingress](../developer/building/webhooks.md) for source scopes,
approved templates, coalescing, bounded normalization, secret rotation, rates,
revocation, dead letters and local verification. Configuring these resources
does not register a GitHub/ADO hook or deploy infrastructure.

Retention defaults to 30 days for terminal receipt history and 30 days for the
first terminal failure's replay window. Durations are 1-3650 whole days, with
replay no longer than history. Read policy/revision through
`getWebhookMetrics().retention.policy`; updates apply to future terminal
dispositions and do not extend existing replay deadlines. The `retention`
snapshot also contains cleanup timestamps and viewer-scoped deletion counters.
Receipt reads include `settledAt`, `receiptExpiresAt`, `replayExpiresAt`,
`payloadRetained`, and `replayAvailable`. Replay reauthorizes even when
`replayAvailable` is true. An expired replay returns `WEBHOOK_REPLAY_EXPIRED`
(410); purged history/cursors return not-found. Cleanup preserves pending work,
queued signals, delivery deduplication and session-creation tombstones.

### Session sharing

| Operation | Route | Access | Summary |

### Management: session groups

Session groups are **private per-user organization**. A group belongs to the
caller who created it; placing a session in a group records a
(viewer, tree-root) *placement* that only changes how the catalog looks **to
that viewer**. Placement requires only **read** access to the session — owners,
collaborators, and recipients of shared sessions all organize the same session
into their *own* groups independently, and none of it changes shared session
data or reveals anyone else's grouping.

| Operation | Route | Parameters | Summary |
|---|---|---|---|
| listSessionGroups | `GET /api/v1/management/session-groups` | — | List **your** session groups. Viewer-scoped for every caller — **admins included**: other users' groups are never returned, and member counts/activity reflect only your own placements. |
| createSessionGroup | `POST /api/v1/management/session-groups` | input (body) | Create a session group owned by the caller. |
| updateSessionGroup | `PATCH /api/v1/management/session-groups/:groupId` | groupId (path), patch (body) | Update group title/description. |
| deleteSessionGroup | `DELETE /api/v1/management/session-groups/:groupId` | groupId (path) | Delete a session group. Its placements are cleared; the sessions themselves are untouched (a non-empty group deletes cleanly). |
| placeSessionsInGroup | `POST /api/v1/management/session-groups/place` | groupId (body), sessionIds (body) | Place session trees into one of the caller's groups (`groupId` null = ungroup). Requires read access to each session; changes no shared session data. |
| assignSessionsToGroup | `POST /api/v1/management/session-groups/:groupId/assign` | groupId (path), sessionIds (body) | **Deprecated** alias of placeSessionsInGroup. |
| moveSessionsToGroup | `POST /api/v1/management/session-groups/move` | groupId (body), sessionIds (body) | **Deprecated** alias of placeSessionsInGroup (groupId null = ungroup). |
| cancelSessionGroup | `POST /api/v1/management/session-groups/:groupId/cancel` | groupId (path), reason (body) | **Deprecated.** Cancel all sessions in a group. |
| completeSessionGroup | `POST /api/v1/management/session-groups/:groupId/complete` | groupId (path), options (body) | **Deprecated.** Complete all sessions in a group. |

**placeSessionsInGroup** request/response:

```jsonc
// POST /api/v1/management/session-groups/place
{ "groupId": "grp-123", "sessionIds": ["sess-a", "sess-b"] }   // groupId: null → ungroup

// result: one row per distinct resolved tree root
[
  { "rootSessionId": "sess-a", "placed": true,  "reason": null },
  { "rootSessionId": "sess-b", "placed": false, "reason": "not_found" }
]
```

- Session ids resolve to their **tree root** before placing (children are never
  placed; duplicates collapse to one row).
- Per-row `reason` on `placed: false`: **`not_found`** — the id is unknown *or*
  the caller cannot read it (identical shape by design; no existence oracle) —
  or **`system`** — system trees cannot be placed.
- The target group must be **owned by the caller**: a missing *or* foreign
  `groupId` fails the whole call with **`403`**
  (`"Session group not found or not owned by you."`) — deliberately not
  distinguishing the two. Cross-user placement is structurally impossible.
- The deprecated aliases (`assignSessionsToGroup`, `moveSessionsToGroup`)
  execute the same viewer-private placement and return the same per-row result
  array.

### Models, agents, policy

| Operation | Route | Parameters | Summary |
|---|---|---|---|
| listModels | `GET /api/v1/models` | — | Viewer-usable runtime provider instances (`catalogKind=runtime_provider`). Direct management callers use `listRuntimeModels(viewer)` for the same semantics; synchronous `listModels()` is the type template catalog. |
| getModelsByProvider | `GET /api/v1/models/by-provider` | — | Model templates grouped by provider type (`catalogKind=provider_type`). Use `listModels` for viewer-usable runtime provider instances. |
| getDefaultModel | `GET /api/v1/models/default` | — | The deployment default model. |
| listCreatableAgents | `GET /api/v1/agents` | — | Agents sessions can be created for. |
| getSessionCreationPolicy | `GET /api/v1/session-creation-policy` | — | Session creation policy. |

### Runtime model providers and defaults

| Operation | Route | Parameters | Summary |
|---|---|---|---|
| listProviders | `GET /api/v1/providers` | — | Shared providers, the caller's personal providers, and admin-visible metadata. Credentials are never returned. |
| getProviderUsageSummary | `GET /api/v1/providers/usage-summary` | days? (14/30/90), providers? (comma-separated names) | The cluster summary from the usage ledger: today / week / month token totals with the input, output and cache split, a per-UTC-day series, and the per-model pivot across providers, reasoning efforts and context tiers. Admins see the cluster, system sessions included; everyone else sees their own turns. |
| createMyProvider | `POST /api/v1/me/providers` | name, type, credentials, baseUrl? (body) | Add a private BYOK provider for the authenticated user. |
| updateMyProviderCredential | `PUT /api/v1/me/providers/:name/credential` | name (path), credentials (body) | Replace the credential on the caller's personal provider while preserving its name, defaults, routing references, and usage history. |
| createProvider **[admin]** | `POST /api/v1/management/providers` | name, type, credentials, baseUrl? (body) | Add a shared cluster provider. |
| updateSharedProviderCredential **[admin]** | `PUT /api/v1/management/providers/:name/credential` | name (path), credentials (body) | Replace the credential on a shared provider while preserving its name, defaults, routing references, and usage history. A personal name reads as not found; a provider seeded from the deployment's model-providers file (its key is an environment-variable pointer) is refused. |
| clearProviderRoutingDependencies | `POST /api/v1/providers/:name/clear-routing` | name (path) | Explicitly clear ordinary/system defaults and agent overrides before deleting a provider. Shared providers require admin. |
| setProviderSystemUse **[admin]** | `PUT /api/v1/management/providers/:name/system-use` | name (path), enabled (body) | Permit system sessions to use the calling admin's personal provider without exposing it to other users. |
| getModelDefaults | `GET /api/v1/model-defaults` | — | Configured/effective user and cluster defaults; admins also receive system routing and per-agent overrides. |
| setModelDefault | `PUT /api/v1/model-defaults` | scope, provider, model, reasoningEffort?, contextTier? (body) | Set/clear a user or cluster ordinary-session default. Cluster scope requires admin. Existing sessions do not change. |
| setSystemModelDefault **[admin]** | `PUT /api/v1/management/system-model-default` | provider, model, reasoningEffort?, contextTier?, restartExisting? (body) | Set/clear the system default; optionally restart inheriting sessions with complete, terminate, or hard_delete. |
| setSystemSessionModel **[admin]** | `PUT /api/v1/management/system-sessions/:agentId/model` | agentId (path), provider, model, reasoningEffort?, contextTier? (body) | Set one persistent system-agent model override. |
| clearSystemSessionModel **[admin]** | `DELETE /api/v1/management/system-sessions/:agentId/model` | agentId (path) | Clear one override and return the agent to the system default. |
| getLegacyProviderMigrationStatus **[admin]** | `GET /api/v1/management/providers/legacy-key-migration` | — | Aggregate legacy GHCP migration status; never returns keys or hashes. |
| adoptLegacySystemGitHubCopilotKey **[admin]** | `POST /api/v1/management/providers/adopt-system-github-key` | name (body) | Copy the legacy synthetic System key server-side into the calling admin's private, system-enabled provider. |
| getProviderStatus | `GET /api/v1/providers/status` | names? (query) | Limits, current-window usage, reset times, and the caller's allowance ceiling. |
| getProviderUsageGrid | `GET /api/v1/providers/usage-grid` | — | Every visible provider/model row with fixed day, week, and month meter windows. |
| getProviderUsage | `GET /api/v1/providers/usage` | days?, provider?, model?, mine?, ownerUserId?, sessionId?, chargeClass?, dimension?, limit? (query) | Historical totals, daily series, and a bounded breakdown. Non-admin reads are owner-scoped except aggregate totals for a named shared provider. |
| setProviderLimit | `PUT /api/v1/providers/:name/limit` | name (path), period, model?, tokens (body) | Save/replace one day, week, or month limit for a provider or one qualified model. Shared requires admin; personal requires owner. |
| removeProviderLimit | `DELETE /api/v1/providers/:name/limit` | name (path), period, model? (query) | Remove one provider/model limit. |
| setProviderAllowance **[admin]** | `PUT /api/v1/management/providers/:name/allowance` | name (path), pct (body) | Set the per-user share of shared-provider limits. |
| setProviderHold **[admin]** | `PUT /api/v1/management/providers/:name/hold` | name (path), untilUtc?, release? (body) | Hold or release new turns against a provider. |
| listPausedSessions | `GET /api/v1/providers/paused` | — | Sessions waiting on a provider, limit, allowance, or hold; fleet-wide for admins, own sessions otherwise. |

Trusted session creation resolves `explicit → user default → cluster default →
first usable provider/model`, validates capabilities, and writes the exact
qualified model before orchestration starts. System sessions resolve
`per-agent override → system default → first system-eligible provider/model`.
System-default restart rollouts are serialized per agent with durable claims;
completed agents are idempotently skipped and failed agents can be retried.
Provider accounting is exactly-once per `(session, turn)`. Historical usage
survives session and provider deletion; current rules/meters are removed with a
deleted provider. The budget table always shows fixed day/week/month windows,
while the selected daily chart offers 14-, 30-, and 90-day history ranges.

### Current user

| Operation | Route | Parameters | Summary |
|---|---|---|---|
| getCurrentUserProfile | `GET /api/v1/me/profile` | — | Profile of the authenticated principal. |
| setCurrentUserProfileSettings | `PATCH /api/v1/me/profile/settings` | settings (body) | Replace profile settings. |
| setCurrentUserGitHubCopilotKey **[legacy]** | `PUT /api/v1/me/github-copilot-key` | key (body) | Legacy rollback API. New users add a private GitHub Copilot runtime provider in Admin Console. |

### System

| Operation | Route | Parameters | Summary |
|---|---|---|---|
| getLogConfig | `GET /api/v1/system/log-config` | — | Log tail availability. |
| getWorkerCount | `GET /api/v1/system/workers` | — | Live worker count. |

## Long polling

`GET …/status/wait?afterVersion=…&timeoutMs=…` holds the request open until
the session's status version advances or the timeout elapses (server-capped
at 25 s default / 300 s max — loop client-side for longer waits).

## Curl example (no-auth deployment)

```bash
BASE=https://portal.example.com/api/v1
SID=$(curl -s -X POST $BASE/sessions -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{}' | jq -r .result.sessionId)
curl -s -X POST $BASE/sessions/$SID/messages -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"prompt": "What is the capital of France?"}'
# poll status / read events
curl -s "$BASE/management/sessions/$SID/events?limit=50" | jq '.result[].eventType'
```


## Feature flags

Settings → Feature flags exposes personal preferences and admin cluster/user controls.
Definitions are published by code migrations; these APIs only manage values.
All paths below are relative to `/api/v1`. A feature key such as
`copilot.native_tasks` is a single path segment.

| Method / path | Operation | Access |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET `/management/features/catalog` | `listFeatureFlags` | Authenticated |
| GET `/management/features/cluster` | `getClusterFeatureFlags` | Authenticated |
| PUT / DELETE `/management/features/cluster/:featureKey` | `setClusterFeatureFlag` / `resetClusterFeatureFlag` | Admin |
| GET `/management/users/me/features` | `getMyFeatureFlags` | Self |
| PUT / DELETE `/management/users/me/features/:featureKey` | `setMyFeatureFlag` / `unsetMyFeatureFlag` | Self |
| GET `/management/users/:userId/features` | `getUserFeatureFlags` | Admin |
| PUT / DELETE `/management/users/:userId/features/:featureKey` | `setUserFeatureFlag` / `unsetUserFeatureFlag` | Admin |
| GET `/management/features/users?query=...` | `listFeatureFlagUsers` | Admin |
| GET `/management/features/changes?limit=50` | `listFeatureFlagChanges` | Admin |

PUT bodies require `enabled`, `expectedRevision` (decimal string), and `requestId`.
Cluster PUT also requires `allowUserOverride`. DELETE takes `expectedRevision`
and `requestId` as query parameters. It removes the setting: cluster reset restores
published defaults, user unset restores inheritance. No per-session setting exists.
All mutations return the committed revision. Stale writes return 409
`FEATURE_CONFLICT`; identical retries with the same actor/request/input return the
original result. Reads include `effective`, `source`, `userOverrideIgnored`, and
configured cluster/user settings. A successful save does not prove worker adoption;
workers report applied revisions/capability in their `feature-flags` state.

The SDK management client exposes the same operation names with a trusted
`FeatureViewer` first argument. Web clients derive the viewer from authentication.
MCP tools use snake case (for example `set_cluster_feature_flag`). Direct MCP mode
requires `PILOTSWARM_MCP_ACTOR_PROVIDER` and `PILOTSWARM_MCP_ACTOR_SUBJECT`; admin
writes additionally require `PILOTSWARM_MCP_FEATURE_ADMIN=true` and the trusted
admin process context. In Web MCP mode, server authentication determines authority.
