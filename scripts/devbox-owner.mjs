// Devbox worker preload — the single source of devbox worker identity.
//
// Loaded via `node --import ./scripts/devbox-owner.mjs` (the `worker:dev` npm
// script) BEFORE the SDK worker constructor reads the environment. This is the
// ONE canonical way to launch a worker on a devbox: `npm run worker:dev`. All
// devbox-specific setup lives here so there is no second, drift-prone launch
// path to keep in sync. It does two things, each idempotent and each
// respecting an explicit override:
//
//  1. Owner. Resolves the signed-in Azure (Entra) identity of whoever is
//     running this devbox and injects it as the worker owner, so the worker
//     claims owner-scoped work induced for generators this user registered.
//     Owner alone is a no-op: scopeWorkerTagFilter only applies the owner by
//     rewriting a concrete tag list. PILOTSWARM_WORKER_TAGS (e.g. repo:myrepo)
//     must also be set for the owner to take effect. That stays in the env
//     file so each devbox declares which repo(s) its generators target.
//     Skipped if PILOTSWARM_WORKER_OWNER_SUBJECT is already set.
//
//  2. Node id. Pins POD_NAME to `devbox-<hostname>` so every restart reuses
//     ONE canonical worker registration. worker.js derives workerNodeId from
//     POD_NAME || os.hostname(); without this pin, a bare-hostname launch
//     registers under a DIFFERENT identity than a `devbox-`-prefixed one,
//     leaving a duplicate row (one live, one aging to `stale`) for a single
//     machine. Skipped if POD_NAME is already set.
//
// It deliberately does NOT set GITHUB_TOKEN from `gh auth token`. A gh-CLI OAuth
// token (`gho_…`) is NOT Copilot-capable — GitHub rejects it for the Copilot
// exchange with HTTP 403 — so injecting it here poisons every session with a
// "key missing or invalid" failure. (A reverted regression, f3055c6b, did this.)
//
// NOTE — the model credential is a SEPARATE concern this preload does NOT solve.
// For `github-copilot:*` models the worker's SessionManager needs a Copilot
// credential (see session-manager.ts, error code GHCP_KEY_MISSING). On a devbox
// the simplest source is the interactively signed-in Copilot user: if
// ~/.copilot/config.json has a non-empty `copilotTokens` map (run the Copilot
// login once), SessionManager falls through to the tokenless CopilotClient,
// which authenticates as that user via COPILOT_HOME — no token needed here.
// Alternatively supply an explicit credential: a per-user GitHub Copilot key in
// Admin, or a Copilot-capable GITHUB_TOKEN (mint via the editor/Copilot
// device-flow, NOT `gh auth token`). Fleet/CI have no signed-in user, so they
// pass that explicit GITHUB_TOKEN via the environment; it is honored unchanged.
// See docs/SDLC_ORCHESTRATION_TESTING.md → "Devbox worker: startup, identity,
// and the Copilot credential".
