# Horizon Harvester

This app demonstrates PilotSwarm's optional EnhancedFactStore + knowledge-graph
providers through two named agents:

- **Source Harvester** (`crawler: true`) — crawls the Northwind Robotics knowledge
  source into durable facts and builds the knowledge graph.
- **Librarian** — answers questions over the harvested knowledge using multi-signal
  search and graph traversal.

Steer users to the agent that fits their task. The harvester ingests and builds; the
librarian retrieves and answers. Only the harvester should crawl or modify the graph in this sample.
