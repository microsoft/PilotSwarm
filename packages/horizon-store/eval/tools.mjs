// eval/tools.mjs — Copilot-SDK tool bridge + agent prompts.
//
// NO ADAPTER: the tools the LLM sees ARE the provider's own agent-tools
// descriptors (src/agent-tools.ts → createFactsTools), bridged 1:1 into the
// Copilot SDK's defineTool shape. The eval measures whether a model can
// harvest correctly GIVEN the 05-tools-spec surface — so the tool names,
// schemas, and descriptions come from the provider, not from this file.
//
// The bridge can RECORD every tool invocation (name, args, result) — SC2
// replays the recorded mutating calls verbatim to prove replay immunity.
