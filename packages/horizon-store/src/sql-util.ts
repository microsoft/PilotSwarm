 * Escape a JS string as a single-quoted AGE Cypher string literal.

 * These literals are consumed by AGE's Cypher (openCypher) parser inside
 * `cypher(graph, $$ ... $$)`, NOT by the SQL parser — so a single quote is
 * escaped with a backslash (`\'`), the Cypher way, NOT by SQL-style doubling
 * (`''`). Doubling produces `'Andres''s VM'`, which the Cypher parser reads as
 * the string `'Andres'` followed by stray tokens → `syntax error at or near
 * "'s VM'"` (verified against live AGE), silently dropping the write. Backslash
 * is escaped first so the quote-escape we add is not itself re-escaped; NULs are
 * stripped.
