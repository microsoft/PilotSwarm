// pilotswarm-horizon-store — public exports.
//
// HorizonDB-backed providers implementing the @pilotswarm/sdk fact/graph
// contracts. The DB-less core (query-builder, graph-model) and the re-exported
// type contracts are the stable, unit-tested surface; HorizonDBFactStore (facts
// + search + embedder) and HorizonDBGraphStore (separate AGE-only graph provider,
// 07 D2) are the live providers validated by the integration suite against a real
// HorizonDB.
