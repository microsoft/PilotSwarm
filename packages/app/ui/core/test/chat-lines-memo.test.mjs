// WHY IT NEEDED CACHING: it wraps the whole transcript to terminal lines and
// runs from scrollPane / scrollPaneTo / the visual-offset helpers — every
// scroll action — usually just to answer "how many lines are there".
// Measured 1.6ms at 300 messages, 5.1ms at 1500, per scroll.
//
// WHY IDENTITY, NOT FIELDS: selectActiveChat is NOT a pure function of the chat
// array. It appends a pending-question message, an answered-question message
// and a session-error message, and branches on branding.
// A cache keyed on `chat` alone would keep showing the old transcript when a
// question arrives. These tests pin each of those invalidations.
