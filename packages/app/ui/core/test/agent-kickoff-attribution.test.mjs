/**
 * An agent's opening instruction must not be attributed to the reader.
 *
 * A packaged agent can carry an `initialPrompt` — the instruction that starts
 * its first turn ("Introduce yourself in one line as Dobby, the R2D train
 * poller…"). It reaches the orchestration as a USER-role prompt, because that
 * is how a turn starts. Nothing marked it as machine-authored, and an
 * unstamped user-role message is rendered from the current viewer's
 * perspective — so every packaged agent's transcript opened with a wall of
 * instructions labelled "You:", which the reader had never written.
 *
 * Two halves, and both are needed:
 *   - client.ts stamps the kickoff with a `kind: "system"` sender. Everything a
 *     person actually sends carries a `kind: "user"` sender stamped at the API
 *     edge from the validated auth context (runtime.js `_buildSender`).
 *   - the chat selector collapses it to one openable line instead of printing
 *     it as a message.
 *
 * Run: node --test test/agent-kickoff-attribution.test.mjs
