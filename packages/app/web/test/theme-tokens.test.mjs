// resolved to a hardcoded GitHub grey in EVERY theme, so that pane quietly
// ignored the palette. Worse, the sequence pane's rules used --ps-text and
// --ps-text-muted with NO fallback: an undefined custom property makes the
// declaration invalid at computed-value time, so those rules did nothing at
// all. Both failures are invisible — no console warning, no broken layout,
// just colours that are subtly not the theme's.

// ── Dialog height on mobile ────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Reported live from an iPhone: the Manage-session dialog was cut off at the
// bottom with its content unreachable. `.ps-modal` already had this fix and
// carries a comment explaining it — iOS Safari's toolbars eat 12-15vh, so a
// `vh` ceiling exceeds what is actually visible. The Manage dialog is a
// SEPARATE overlay (`.ps-share-*`) and never inherited it.
//
// The second half of the bug is subtler: these dialogs set `height`, not
// `max-height`, so a viewport clamp on `max-height` alone does nothing. A
// fixed-height flex child in a centred, padded overlay overflows BOTH ends,
// which is why the action row went off-screen with no way to scroll to it.
