// Selected rows must have readable text in EVERY theme.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS: three rules painted a selected row with
// `background: var(--ps-modal-selected-background)` and
// `color: var(--ps-selection-background)`. The second is a FILL colour — it is
// what sits BEHIND text, so nothing ever constrained it against the fill in
// front of it. In 9 of 20 themes those two tokens are the same colour, and 8 of
// those are an exact match: the selected row rendered as a solid coloured bar
// with the label invisible inside it.
//
// It survived so long because the two DEFAULT themes (workspace-dark,
// github-dark) are the only ones where the two tokens happen to agree, so the
// bug never appeared during development — only after someone switched theme.
//
// Two checks, deliberately of different kinds:
//   1. the palette — every theme's selected pair is actually readable
//   2. the stylesheet — no rule pairs the selection fill with a fill as text
//
// Check 2 is a source scan, which is normally a weak detector. It is narrow on
// purpose: it looks only at declaration blocks that set the selected
// background, and asserts about the one property in them that has burned us
// twice. It is not a general "does the CSS look right" regex.
