// Resizing a pane must not re-lay-out the whole loaded transcript.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS: dragging a splitter on a long session was a slideshow. The
// transcript is not virtualised — every loaded block is in the DOM — and a
// resize changes the wrap width, so the browser re-lays-out all of them on
// every frame. The cost is linear in node count (~1.55ms per 1000 nodes
// measured), and a session's window can reach 10k events.
//
// content-visibility on each block makes the browser skip layout for anything
// offscreen. Measured on a 30k-node transcript: 49.6ms -> 2.9ms per re-layout.
// These tests guard both the declaration (deterministic) and the outcome.

// These used to target `.ps-rich-chat`, the rich renderer, served by asking the
// stub for a "workspace-dark-rich" theme. Both are gone: the rich renderer was
// retired and that theme no longer exists, so the selector matched nothing and
// all three tests timed out rather than failing loudly.
//
// They now measure the surviving transcript, which is the one that ships. That
// mattered: the content-visibility optimization had been lost along with the
// old renderer, and re-layout was back at 6-8ms — the exact cost this file was
// written to prevent — with nothing red to say so.
