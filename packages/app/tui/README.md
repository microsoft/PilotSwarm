# PilotSwarm TUI

Terminal UI for PilotSwarm.

Install:

```bash
npm install pilotswarm
```

For app-specific worker modules or direct SDK imports, also add:

```bash
npm install pilotswarm-sdk
```

Run locally against a plugin directory:

```bash
npx pilotswarm local --env .env --plugin ./plugin --worker ./worker-module.js
```

The `pilotswarm` package provides the shipped TUI (`pilotswarm-cli` remains a
bin alias). Your app customizes it with `plugin/plugin.json`,
`plugin/agents/*.agent.md`, `plugin/skills/*/SKILL.md`, and optional worker-side
tools.

The shipped files inspector supports shared artifact browsing, download, local open, and delete flows. Binary artifacts download intact rather than being coerced through UTF-8 text previews.

Portal/runtime helpers are exported from `pilotswarm/host`; shared UI layers
are exported from `pilotswarm/ui-core` and `pilotswarm/ui-react`.
