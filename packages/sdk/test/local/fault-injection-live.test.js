/**
 * LITERAL crash matrix (session lifecycle protocol §4.4) — real process
 * kills at exact protocol boundaries, real duroxide re-dispatch, real LLM
 * turns, shared filesystem snapshot store across separate worker processes.
 *
 * Each scenario:
 *   1. forks worker A with PILOTSWARM_FAULT_INJECT armed (exit(137) at a
 *      named boundary, usually on the 2nd hit so turn 1 commits healthy),
 *   2. runs turn 1 healthy, sends turn 2, and watches A die AT the boundary,
 *   3. forks a clean worker B; duroxide re-dispatches the in-flight turn
 *      (work-item lock 2s + session lock ~30s reclaim),
 *   4. asserts the ORACLE: the client gets a reply, the store's version
 *      chain is exactly right (recovery must never double-commit a turn),
 *      the recovering worker's dir ends clean (marker == store version, no
 *      sentinel), and no lossy replay occurred.
 *
 * The invariant distinguishing pre-CAS from post-CAS kills:
 *   - kill BEFORE the CAS  → the turn re-RUNS on B  → store ends at v2
 *     because B committed it (B hydrates v1 first).
 *   - kill AFTER the CAS   → already-committed recovery → store ends at v2
 *     because A committed it; B must NOT commit again (v3 would mean the
 *     turn double-applied).
 * A follow-up turn 3 then proves the session converged (v3, correct reply).
