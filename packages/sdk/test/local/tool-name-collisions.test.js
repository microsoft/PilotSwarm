/**
 * Regression: PilotSwarm-registered tools must not collide with
 * Copilot SDK built-in tools. The SDK validator (`validateExternalToolOverrides`
 * in @github/copilot/app.js) throws
 *
 *     External tool "<name>" conflicts with a built-in tool of the same name.
 *     Set overridesBuiltInTool: true to explicitly override it.
 *
 * for any external tool whose name shadows a built-in unless `overridesBuiltInTool`
 * is set on that tool. PilotSwarm intentionally avoids overrides except where the
 * semantics genuinely overlap (currently none).
 *
 * The known SDK 1.0.32 built-in tool names that flow through `cli.toolInit` and
 * end up in the validator's check set are listed below. They were enumerated by
 * grepping `node_modules/@github/copilot/app.js` for `{name:"..."}` literals
 * inside the agent tool subsystem (excluding desktop-automation MCP tools and
 * MCP prompt primitives, which are not in the validator's set).
