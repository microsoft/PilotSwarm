/**
 * Every Web API operation is reachable from the web management client (pure,
 * no database, no network).
 *
 * The protocol table is the single source of truth for the portal's routes,
 * `ApiClient`'s request building, and the API reference. The web management
 * client used to be hand-ported one method at a time and drifted badly: 60 of
 * 115 operations implemented, with 30 methods reachable only through the
 * direct (datastore) client — including `grantSessionShare` /
 * `setSessionVisibility` / `getSessionAccess`, the authorization primitives
 * themselves, whose HTTP routes existed the whole time.
 *
 * The cure is `client.ops`: the canonical surface, generated from the table,
 * complete by construction. These tests pin the three things that keep it
 * from drifting again:
 *   1. `ops` covers every operation in the table, exactly — no gaps, no
 *      strays.
 *   2. The generated file is in sync with the table — adding an operation
 *      without regenerating fails here rather than at a call site months
 *      later.
 *   3. The hand-written ergonomic layer stays a layer OVER the wire, not a
 *      fork of it.
 *
 * Run: node --test test/unit/web-client-op-coverage.test.mjs
