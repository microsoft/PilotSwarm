# pilotswarm-sdk

Durable runtime primitives for building apps on top of PilotSwarm.

Download the SDK asset from a published Microsoft release, then install it:

```bash
gh release download vX.Y.Z --repo microsoft/PilotSwarm --pattern 'pilotswarm-sdk-*.tgz' --dir dist-tarballs
npm install ./dist-tarballs/pilotswarm-sdk-X.Y.Z.tgz
```

Release assets are public; repository membership is not required. See the
[package installation guide](https://github.com/microsoft/PilotSwarm/blob/main/docs/quickstart/packages.md)
for anonymous downloads and checksum verification. Microsoft distributes
npm-format release assets, not npm registry publications. Install the matching Horizon-store
tarball as well when using its optional providers.

Minimal usage:

```ts
import { PilotSwarmClient, PilotSwarmWorker, defineTool } from "pilotswarm-sdk";
```

Client apps connect to a deployment's Web API (web mode):

```ts
const client = new PilotSwarmClient({ apiUrl: "https://portal.example.com" });
await client.start();
const session = await client.createSession();
const reply = await session.sendAndWait("hello");
```

Pass `getAccessToken` for authenticated deployments; use `PilotSwarmManagementClient({ apiUrl, getAccessToken? })` for management operations. Constructing a client directly with `{ store }` is internal (worker/portal-host embedding and testing) — see the [Web API reference](https://github.com/microsoft/PilotSwarm/blob/main/docs/api/reference.md).

### Node-only authentication bootstrap

Server-side Node.js applications can discover a deployment's authentication
mode and build that `getAccessToken` callback:

```ts
import { createNodeWebAuth } from "pilotswarm-sdk/node-auth";

const auth = await createNodeWebAuth({ apiUrl: process.env.PILOTSWARM_API_URL! });
const client = new PilotSwarmClient({
  apiUrl: process.env.PILOTSWARM_API_URL!,
  getAccessToken: auth.getAccessToken,
});
```

The `node-auth` entry point is intentionally not a browser API. The deployment
selects the provider. For authenticated deployments, an explicit `token`
option takes precedence over `PILOTSWARM_API_TOKEN`; setting `token` to `null`
suppresses environment fallback. Dev auth similarly uses explicit `devUser`
before `PILOTSWARM_DEV_USER`.

For identity auth, pass a caller-owned `TokenCredential`, or let the bootstrap
own a `DefaultAzureCredential`. Access tokens are cached until shortly before
expiry and concurrent refreshes are collapsed. Call `auth.close()` when done;
caller-owned credentials are never closed by the bootstrap. Discovery and
token-acquisition errors reject with `NodeWebAuthError` rather than silently
falling back to anonymous access.

Workers are trusted backend components and always attach directly to the store:

```ts
const worker = new PilotSwarmWorker({ store: process.env.DATABASE_URL });
```

`pilotswarm-sdk` ships PilotSwarm's embedded framework prompt, framework skills, and management plugins inside the package. App code should provide its own `plugin/` directory and worker-side tool handlers on top of that base.

Packages may contain skills, worker tools, MCP servers, authored agent workflows,
or any combination of them; agent files are optional. With the opt-in Base Agent
V2 policy, sessions progressively search visible static, published, and curated
capabilities, load only the guidance they need, and attach selected permitted
tools or MCP servers at the next turn boundary. Existing sessions retain the V1
framework unless the feature is enabled, and Base V2 requires native tasks.

Artifact note:

- `write_artifact` remains the standard way for agents to create downloadable files.
- Text artifacts work as before.
- Binary artifacts are supported by supplying `contentType` plus `encoding: "base64"` when the agent writes the file; downloads preserve the raw bytes.

Common docs:

- SDK apps: `https://github.com/microsoft/PilotSwarm/blob/main/docs/developer/building/sdk-apps.md`
- SDK agents: `https://github.com/microsoft/PilotSwarm/blob/main/docs/developer/building/sdk-agents.md`
- Configuration: `https://github.com/microsoft/PilotSwarm/blob/main/docs/developer/reference/configuration.md`
- Architecture: `https://github.com/microsoft/PilotSwarm/blob/main/docs/architecture/system.md`

If you want the shipped terminal UI, portal, and MCP server, install
`pilotswarm` (`pilotswarm-cli` is only a bin alias inside that package).
