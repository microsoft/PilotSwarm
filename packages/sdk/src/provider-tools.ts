/**
 * Provider budget tools — the agent surface over providers, limits,
 * allowances, holds and usage.
 *
 * The same capabilities the MCP server registers, under the same names
 * and with the same arguments (docs/proposals/providers-and-budgets-surface.md).
 * A session runs `provider:model` and that provider is charged for every turn
 * it takes; a provider is SHARED (an administrator made it, anyone may spend
 * from it) or PERSONAL (its creator's own credentials, nobody else sees it).
 *
 * AUTHORITY. One tool set, two scopes, decided by `resolveViewer`:
 *   - the Token Manager      → {userId: null, isAdmin: true}: the whole cluster
 *   - a user's Token Manager → the session OWNER's user id, with the role
 *     freshly resolved for that person
 * Nothing below asks whether the caller may do the thing. Every call reaches a
 * `cms_provider_*` procedure carrying the viewer, and the procedure raises
 * PROVIDER_FORBIDDEN / PROVIDER_NOT_FOUND when they may not — which is why an
 * administrator's tools and a user's tools are the same tools. Branching
 * on `isAdmin` here would be a second copy of a rule that already lives in
 * SQL, and the two would eventually disagree.
 *
 * THE TWO-PLACE TRAP. A tool the model can call needs BOTH a declaration in
 * `ManagedSession.systemToolDefs()` and a handler registered for the turn. A
 * handler with no declaration is invisible to the model; a declaration with no
 * handler HANGS the turn, because the CLI drops a call it has no handler for
 * without answering. Both halves are built from the one `PROVIDER_TOOL_SPECS`
 * table below, so a schema is written once and cannot drift.
 *
