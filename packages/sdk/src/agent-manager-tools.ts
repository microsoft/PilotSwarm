/**
 * The Agent Manager write bundle — package mutation, diffing and import.
 *
 * Kept out of `inspect-tools.ts` deliberately: that file is the READ surface
 * and its grep-guard reasons about session-scoped reads. These tools are
 * package-scoped and mutating, with a different authorization story
 * (creator-or-admin on the package, not visibility on a session), and mixing
 * the two would blur which rule applies where.
 *
 * **Authorization is not implemented here.** Every mutation calls the same
 * `agent-package-service` / catalog functions the Web API calls, which enforce
 * creator-or-admin inside the database with a row lock. That is the whole
 * point of §4: one authz implementation serving portal, CLI, MCP and the
 * manager, so a tool cannot become a side door.
