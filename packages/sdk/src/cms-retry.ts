/**
 * CMS retry helper for orchestration activities.
 *
 * Two policies:
 *
 * - `cmsRetryCritical`: 4 retries at 1s / 5s / 15s / 90s (5 total attempts).
 *   The first three handle transient blips (connection reset, deadlock,
 *   serialization failure, brief unavailability). The 90s tail handles
 *   PostgreSQL maintenance windows (failover, restart, connection storm).
 *   On exhaustion or non-transient error, the original error is thrown so
 *   the orchestration's own classification still works.
 *
 * - `cmsRetryBestEffort`: 3 retries at 1s / 4s / 12s (4 total attempts).
 *   For non-flow-critical writes (event log entries, etc.). A single short
 *   retry is not enough to ride out a connection storm — when `max_connections`
 *   is momentarily exhausted (many worker pods contending for the same server),
 *   the pool keeps failing to acquire for several seconds, and dropping the
 *   write silently loses observability events (e.g. `tool.execution_complete`,
 *   which the streaming client depends on). The short exponential ladder gives
 *   the storm time to clear while still bounding the added post-turn latency.
 *   On exhaustion or non-transient error, logs and returns `undefined` instead
 *   of throwing. Callers that don't care about the return value can ignore it.
 *
 * All delays carry ±20% jitter so that a fleet of pods that hit the same
 * connection ceiling at the same moment does not retry in lockstep (a
 * thundering herd that would keep the server saturated).
 *
 * Only PostgreSQL transient errors trigger a retry. Constraint violations,
 * syntax errors, and other deterministic failures propagate immediately —
 * retrying those just delays the inevitable.

/**
 * Transient error taxonomy.
 *
 * Every retryable failure is grouped into exactly one CATEGORY. A category is a
 * generic bucket — `{ tag, sqlStates, networkCodes, messagePatterns }` — so new
 * kinds of transient (e.g. a future rate-limit or replica-lag class) are added
 * by appending one row here, with no change to the retry loop or the callers.
 *
 * The category `tag` is surfaced in the retry logs (`category=<tag>`), so
 * connection-slot exhaustion is analyzable/alertable on its own WITHOUT being a
 * separate code path — it is simply the `connection_saturation` bucket. Anything
 * not covered by a category is non-transient and propagates immediately.
 *
 * SQLSTATE references (postgres docs):
 *   08xxx — connection exception family
 *   40001 — serialization failure (could not serialize access due to concurrent update)
 *   40P01 — deadlock detected
 *   53300 — too many connections   53400 — configuration limit exceeded
 *   57014 — query canceled (e.g. statement_timeout)
 *   57P01/02/03 — admin shutdown / crash shutdown / cannot connect now
