/**
 * Inspect Tools — read-only inspection tools for agents.
 *
 * `read_agent_events` is available to every session. It lets an ancestor
 * read the durable event stream of a descendant in its spawn tree using
 * the existing `session_events.seq` cursor.
 *
 * A small read-only subset is exposed to permanent system agents so they can
 * inspect sessions and owner-scoped usage without mutating state. The deeper
 * diagnostic tools are the diagnostic bundle — historically the `agent-tuner`
 * system agent's alone, and soon an installable package's (see
 * docs/proposals/agent-authoring-capability.md).
 *
 * ── The viewer spine ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 * These tools used to take no principal at all: `agentIdentity` decided
 * everything, and the tuner bypassed the one scoping rule that existed. That
 * was sound only while the sole holder was an ownerless system session. The
 * moment a USER-owned session holds the diagnostic bundle, "no principal"
 * becomes "every principal", so every session-touching tool now resolves a
 * viewer from its session's OWNER and routes through one of three rules:
 *
 *   scopeSessions(rows)          — lists: filter to what the viewer may see
 *   ensureVisible(id)            — direct reads: refuse what they may not
 *   requireAdmin(tool)           — fleet aggregates, which have neither a
 *                                  session id nor a session list to filter
 *
 * A tool that touches sessions and uses none of the three is a bug; the
 * inspect-viewer-spine test greps for exactly that.
 *
 * The decision itself is NOT reimplemented here — `evaluateSessionAccess`
 * comes from pilotswarm-sdk/api, the same function the portal's HTTP routes
 * call, so a rule change lands on both surfaces at once.
 *
 * Inspect tools never mutate state.
